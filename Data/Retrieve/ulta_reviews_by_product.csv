daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Best exfoliant to help with acne scarring,"This product is amazing but most people don't know how to use it correctly. You have to add enough water so that the consistency is more watery paste like. If you don't add enough water it can irritate your skin. However, when you learn to use it correctly, it is the most effective and gentle exfoliator I have ever used. I use it everyday I the mornings, and I have seen a MAJOR difference in my skin text and dark spots. My skin is so smooth! It can be a bit messy, that's why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star..",Kentucky,No,5,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,love it,"I've been using it for 2 months and I love it. My face looks brighter and more of an even tone. I've never had problems with acne, so I can't give my opinion if it works on acne or not. I just ordered me an extra bottle.",Galena park,No,2,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,heaven sent!,"I never knew anything about this before getting my first facial at my local Ulta. I have used this product every single day since the day it was introduced to me and it will forever be incorporated in my skincare routine. This product has cleared up almost ALL the dark spots i used to have on the sides of my face. My skin tone is so much more clearer than it was less than 2 months ago and it just keeps getting better. I started really paying attention to my skin care routine and what i use on my face for the past 2 months and i can honestly say, when people ask me ""what did you do?!"", this product has made the biggest difference. If applied correctly, this product is not harsh on your skin at all (at least not for me). This product is not messy - you only need a little - if you feel this product is messy you're using way too much. And lastly, the price... I'll leave any one who is skeptical with this - You get what you pay for. I'm a clearance/sale girl all day don't get me wrong! But when it comes to your face and your skin in general - somethings are just worth the money. I could've EASILY gotten something different for a way cheaper price - but i highly doubt i would have the result i have today and i doubt i would see the results i have today in such short time with any other cheap product. This product can be considered pricey to some - but for these RESULTS if you ask me the price isn't enough! You will not regret. Definitely stop into your local Ulta salon and get the 10 minute fit facial! That way you can be advised of your skin type and pointed in the right direction of which brands you should be using that best work for your skin type.",Tampa. Florida,No,6,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Loved this from the first time I used it!,I've used this product only twice now and I really love it! I almost expected it to be harsh and drying but it's not. It's very gentle and gives my skin a very clean feeling. I bought it while it was on sale at Ulta and will repurchase. It's honestly a very nice product.,"Columbus, Ohio",No,1,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Please Read My Review!,"I was first introduced to this product when I was in school to become an esthetician and I'm just as in love with it now as I was back then. I have dry, sensitive skin but this does not bother it at all. I was using Tatcha Rice Powder but that started making me break out in hives so I switched back to this. It evens out my skin texture, brightens, and helps control my occasional hormonal breakouts on my chin. I use it every night after I wash my face and before I apply my toner/serum/moisturizer. It's not intended to remove make up so make sure you still remove make up prior to using this. Also it does come out as a powder so some say it can be ""messy"" but you only need a little bit and that goes a long way. Make sure you add just enough water to make it a foamy paste (too little of water and its harsh on the skin; too much water and it'll just seep through your hands and down the sink). Even though I don't have oily or acne prone skin, I'd still recommend this to those who do because of the papain and salicylic acid thats in it will help you along with other products you already use. It's pricy but its worth it and the regular size bottle will last you a long time. You'll get your moneys worth. Just because you had a bad reaction doesn't mean everybody who is considering buying this product will btw. Everyones skin is different. Ask for a sample before you commit.","Fort Worth, TX",No,4,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Why does this smell like baby spit up?,I've been using this product for 2 weeks now and I do admit that it has help to decrease the size of my pores. Besides that it hasn't helped my skin that much at all. I have acne and post acne marks which I was hoping it would help lighten or get rid of. Also it smells like baby spit up. Gross! Hasn't helped clear up my acne either.,Southern Vermont,No,1,1
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Seriously ?! This isn't real,"I had bought this online with the 21 days of saving sale and let me tell you something the first use! I can notice a difference in my face the instant softness in unreal. It's been such a good product in my skin routine ever since i received it in the mail. And i bought 2 just in case i fell in love with it so i didn't have to pay full price the next time and I'm so glade i did. It has made my acne clear up again and my skin so soft, and lets just talk about how my makeup looks after OMG! Flawless! Highly recommend this product",Delray,No,2,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Made my skin WORSE,"I have ezcema on my face and it gets flaky and dry, so I thought this would be great since it's supposed to have calming ingredients and is exfoliating. I waited 2-3 weeks of getting my ezcema under control with diligent care before I tried this product and it was a HUGE mistake. I finally got my skin back to being pretty and balanced in moisture and within MINUTES of using this product, my face BURNED and FLARED again!!!!!! Not only did it bring back the redness and flare of ezcema, but now my face HURTS and is OILY. It burns and I can't touch it and its been 8 hours since I used this product. It's like a chemical burn that made my skin oily. MASSIVE mistake. It's so difficult to get my flares under control and this destroyed WEEKS worth of work in minutes. I've NEVER had a reaction like this to anything before.......My skin was finally pretty and then this destroyed it. Very much regretting this.","Trabuco Canyon, CA",No,1,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Expensive but worth it,I was hesitant to try this because of how expensive it is but I decided to go for it when it was on sale (during 21 days of beauty) and I absolutely love it! It leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth. I have always struggled with acne and large pores and this really cleans them out.,"Aurora, Co",No,1,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,"Okay, not great","You have to be careful with how much water you use. Too much, and the exfoliating bits turn to mush. Too little, at it feels like sand paper",Boston,No,1,1
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,I love it,"I have SUPER sensitive skin, and I got this at 21 days of beauty and I am in LOVE! It doesn't irritate my skin at all, gets all my flakes off and I have noticed I am clearing up which is really hard for me to do. I dont think I will ever switch. First exfoliater that isn't killing my skin!!","Blaine, Mn",No,1,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Reviews are Misleading!,"I got this during the most recent beauty sale; for me this was a splurge even at 50% off but I wanted something gentle to help relieve breakouts and exfoliate dry skin, and this stuff had so many great reviews with people saying it was worth every penny! I can say that after using this each time, my skin did feel very soft. It did exfoliate, but also made my skin feel tight afterward. I read reviews saying not to overuse it at first, so I started in with this twice a week for about 3 weeks. First time it seemed ok. Every time after that, I'd wake up the next morning with little pimples forming all over that weren't there the night before. They'd take a few days to go away, then I'd try using this again, same result, more breakouts to deal with the next morning. I finally just returned it; too expensive for something that is going to create more problems than it solves.","Phx, AZ",No,4,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Should you buy or not? Read below...,"I have really problematic oily skin. Mini-pimples and bumps all over chin and jaw-line area. Bumps all over my cheekbone area all the way up to my temples. So far, it exfoliates well. It makes my skin look like glass skin whenever I use it. It really cleans out my texture and pores. & It makes your skin really soft after ridding all that layer of gunk! One con would be that it dries out your skin right after use but most exfoliators do anyways. Just moisturize really well right after. This bottle is huge and you don't need much for your face, so it'll last you a long, long, long time. However, I do recommend that you test it out first to see how you would like your paste to feel like on your face. Too little water will feel like sand paper on your skin, too much water and you won't get any good use out of it. Overall, I recommend it! (Just not the hefty price-tag.)","Sacramento, Cali",No,6,1
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Amazing,"I didn't notice a difference until after 2 weeks of continuous usage. Really got rid of my acne and made my skin better over all.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,The Best Thing Ever!,"This Microfoliant is amazing- I suffer from severe hyperpigmentation, and this stuff combined with my skincare routine has done wonders for my skin. When I feel like my skin needs some TLC, I put this on after cleaning my face with tea tree soap. Then I tone my face with HP (don't judge, it stings but it works) after I exfoliate with this, or follow with some good ole aloe vera. Vitamin e for moisturizer, and I'm set all day!","Dallas, TX",Yes,0,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Love it!!!,I have been using this product for about 6 months. I originally received it as a bonus free sample and have not looked back. I'm a 40 something year old woman who developed adult acne during pregnancy and was never able to get rid of it. This led to scaring and very uneven skin tones.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Gentle yet effective,"I am a 47 year old fair skinned female that typically uses Merle Norman skin care but decided it was time for a change. This face microfoliant is very much like the old Body Shop Chinese Rice Clarifying Polishing Powder that is no longer sold. Truly only a nickel sized amount will work for an entire face. It feels decadent when using because it turns creamy yet you can feel the chalky grains gently scrubbing your pores. I have extremely sensitive skin but after using this microfoliant my skin is not red or irritated. I use it every night and then follow it up with a light moisturizer. By morning my skin looks refreshed and younger, (or so I think). Definitely worth its weight in gold but yes it's pricier that other high end face scrubs.","Anthem, AZ",Yes,1,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,effective gentle exfoliating,"for anyone who's skeptical of exfoliants that are too fine.... this is an exception. that was my way of thinking when I used a heavier granule exfoliator, then switched to sugar, and finally mud masks. they did the trick for a bit, but what they ultimately left me with was overworked skin. my sensitive skin just couldn't take the excessive scrubbing and drying out from the clay. a friend recommended this to me, and while I thought It'd do nothing for me, it did. Now use this once or twice a week along with other cleansers, and my skin has bounced back with smaller pores and a less red complexion.",Los Angeles,No,0,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,I love this!,I use this product every other day and so far it's doing it's job great. It's not too rough on the skin but still exfoliates enough to where you feel a difference. My skin is normally flaky but when I started using this it all went away!,Utah,No,1,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Awesome Product,I use this product in the shower about 2-3 times a week. It's fine for daily use but it's rather expensive so I skip days to conserve it.

I get a lot of compliments on my skin tone (for my age).,"Conroe, TX",Yes,2,1
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Great exfoliant,I have learned my lesson...you pay for your results...you buy cheap no results.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Good exfoliant,"I spoke to the store estetician during this purchase. She let me try it before I buy it. It has a very very fine grain. I bought it to help with milia spots (tiny white heads that get stuck under the skin after a pimple has healed). First wash your face, then while your face is still wet, put a bit of the dust in your palm and mix with just a few drops of water. Not enough water and it does dry on your face as you are massaging onto skin. I have had it for close to a week and although I don't see a major improvement just yet, I can tell that it is definitely helping remove dead layers of skin and getting those little buggers closer to the surface.","Fargo, ND",Yes,0,0

My face was becoming inflamed and itchy and I couldn't figure out why..Too much Salicylic Acid!

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Aggravated acne,"I spent well over $200 dollars on many products from this line after a recommendation from a skin specialist after facial at the Ulta salon as well as recommendations from a stand alone Dermalogica store.

My skin has just gotten worse and worse, I finally got tired of it and returned all the products and went back to my previous cheaper brand that has worked for me in the past.

I used to use St. Ives Apricot Scrub (too harsh) & Dr. Brandt's Microdermabrasion (too drying) before faithfully. This is the best exfoliant I've tried thus far. It's a powder that transforms into a scrub after wetting and rubbing your hands together. My face has never felt so smooth. It also doesn't dry my face out. I tried the mini version but I'll definitely be purchasing a full size soon. I use it once a week, but only bc I use a harsher microexfoliant once a week as well (bc of eczema). However, once I use all of my other exfoliants up, I'll probably only purchase this product though.","Virginia Beach, VA",Yes,0,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Great!!!,This product was recommended by one of the skin specialists at Ulta and let me tell you He was right.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,100% Must Have!,I wasn't sure if this would be too harsh for my ultra picky skin. To say I was pleasantly surprised with this amazing little bottle of magical white powder is an understatement. I cannot say enough about how great this product is. It is gentle but so effective. I purchased the smaller size not sure I was going to like it enough to commit to the full size. I will 100% be pirchasing the full size - over and over again.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,An ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE!!!,"I had a HUGE issue with dry skin around my lips, on my chin, and on the sides of my nose. Ever since using this product, the dryness has gone away, and the dry-spot scars on my chin are lightening up to the point to where you can barely see them. The first day after using it, my face felt a little raw, but that went away the next day. I HIGHLY recommend this product. I use it every single day. I've noticed major differences in my skin. I will definitely be keeping myself stocked with this product!",Commerce City Co,No,0,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Made my whole face peel off after one use!,"I went to Ulta looking for a different microfoliant product and the sales person recommended this product instead. I explained that I have very sensitive skin and needed something gentle. Instead, I got this product that made all of the skin peel off my face after one use! The peeling lasted for nearly a week and left angry red marks around the side of my mouth that I am still trying to get rid of a month later. If your skin is at all sensitive, avoid this product like the plague! If I could give it less than one star I would!",Wisconsin,No,7,10
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,LOVE,"I started off using this morning and night but being that I have rosacea I switched to once a day. It's amazing, it clears off all the dry and textured patches. Applying it can be a little tricky because it's a powder and you have to add water to create the consistency you want, sometimes the product leaks out of your hand. Overall great product","Augusta, GA",Yes,1,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Instantly smoother skin,This stuff instantly makes my face feel softer and smoother. I use it every evening after cleansing and I could tell the difference after the first time I used it.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Love it,"I had gotten a microdermabrasion at Ulta and they used this during it, so I decided to buy a mini one to try out and it is amazing! It comes out in a powder but once you add water it will become a paste and you can make it as rough or easy on your skin as you want. It left my face feeling clean and soft. That being said, I only use it once to twice a week to keep my skin from becoming irritated.","Danbury, CT",Yes,1,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Wow,"This gently removes dead skin cells and impurities with each use. You can smell that it's rice-based; not a heavy scent, but a little different. That said, I'd rather have that then an artificial scent ingredient added. No lingering scent once washed off. ""Doesn't Remove Makeup"" shouldn't be an option on the CONS list. This is an exfoliant and should be used after you've cleansed your skin. I would assume that it wouldn't remove makeup, it's not supposed to. I've got very dry sensitive skin and am able to use this twice daily - it's awesome! Took a couple times to figure how much to use and how to avoid making a mess. Once you get it down, like most Dermalogica products, a little goes a long way!",Wisconsin,Yes,1,0

I didn't really have intentions of making this a part of my routine, but now I can't live without and notice a difference for the worse in my skin when I do not use it.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,A Wonderful Exfoliant!,"While perusing Dermalogica's wide range of products, this was always a product that I glossed over. I didn't have any interest in it, as I already had an exfoliant that I had currently been using and was fine with. It wasn't until after I had gotten at facial at Ulta by one of their skincare specialists, that I fell in love with this product. It's a very fine, powder-like consistency that, when mixed with water, turns into a paste. It's very gentle, exfoliates nicely and doesn't irritate my skin or break me out. I use it two to three times per week after cleansing. Highly recommend if you have dry, oily, combination or even sensitive skin!",Florida,No,1,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,I would buy this over and over again.,"If you are looking for a ""quick fix"" this product is not for you. This product will make your skin irritated and red, why? You ask because it's an ""EXFULIANT"" even if it is a labeled ""Microfoliant"" it's made to exfoliate the skin and will leave it red and will leave your skin dry and flaky the first couple of times. This product is for every day use to take off the dead layers of skin. If you do not want your nasty dead layers off and rather have a product keep your skin the same or slightly better THIS IS NOT FOR YOU! After you use this product make sure to use a SUPER HYDRATING lotion. I DO NOT reccoment you using makeup right after this product especially after the first couple of uses it will make your skin peel. Let your skin breathe for at least a week before applying makeup. (Makeup after your done peeling looks flawless after the use of this product for about over 2 weeks of the use of the Microfoliant)After about a week or so your skin should look and feel brand new and you should never have the skin peeling issue again. Maybe on your nose every once in a while or spots on your face. This is NORMAL because your dead skin is coming off. Every year we Shed pound of dead skin. Don't be shocked when you see it come off it's NORMAL. This product is amazing and has helped my skin (little to no acne dry skin) and my sisters skin (acne prone and combination oily) also my brother uses it when he want a good clean look (oily skin and acne prone) like I said if you want a quick fix like all the people rating this a 1 this is NOT for you.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,LOVE THIS,"I love this product!! It has just enough grit that I can feel it exfoliating and doing its job. But it dissolves quickly which makes it easy to rinse away! It's also gentle enough that I can use it every day and it doesn't bother my sensitive skin. The only con to me is that it's a little pricey for the average buyer, but Clearly it doesn't bother me too much, as I will continue to buy this again and again!",Kansas,Yes,2,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Already Love It After 1 Week!,"I recently got a facial at the skinbar and was introduced to this product. I have been using the dermalogica brand for about 3 months and it's done wonders for my skin. I have been jumping from brands for the past 3 years with nothing working and my acne continued to get worse. After using demalogica, my cystic acne has greatly improved and I just get the occasional breakout here and there. Now, with clearer skin, I was looking for a product to help with my uneven skin due to years of acne scars. I won't say that after 1 week my scars are gone, but my skin feels amazing and I have less redness overall.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,BEST EXFOLIATOR EVER!,"I LOVE THIS!!! Bless the woman at Ulta that recommended this product to me. I use to use a Neutrogena face scrub for exfoliating since I use to have bad breakouts. But I started to develop sensitive skin and my face was constantly red and bumpy because I kept using Neutrogena (because I needed it to clear/clean my skin) but it also was damaging my skin (causing irritation). Ulta staff recommended this to me as an exfoliator and I LOVE IT! Sometimes I use it every day and sometimes I can use it here and there (it depends on weather/makeup usage for the week) but that's how good this product is! It's a great exfoliator for sensitive skin or daily cleanser. It has cleared up my skin from scars from picking pimples, cleaned pores, and overall left my skin feeling smooth).

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Very Dissapointed,"After reading all the great comments regarding this product and brand, I decided to give it a go! I'm very strict with my skincare regime and am a lover of skincare products, so this one seemed like a great new addition! I have normal skin and at the time of use, had no acne or open acne marks/other impurities. I followed the directions percisely and it seemed as though my skin really reddened from the product, enough so that one of my go-to heavy foundations wouldn't even cover it. I woke up the next morning to my skin peeling off on my cheeks, leaving behind open sores & burns that have now scarred. Ulta was very helpful in the matter and I contacted actual company Dermalogica with pictures and asking for advice on how to fix this and never received word back. I do not have overly sensitive skin so I don't know why this happened.

I've been using this for two and a half year and it still works ! What I like about this is that you can use it everyday because of how light the exfoliant is. People get confused and think the hard the exfoliant the better, but that is NOT true. You are damaging the skin when you use something rough. I have acne prone skin, sensitive, redness, uneven skin tone and since I've been using this it has made my skin soft, even less red, less to NO ACNE, and brighter which is a plus. If you are hesitant on trying this please do so ! Also, if you have acne prone skin i would also consider buying the special clearing wash from dermalogica as well.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Love It!,"This product is wonderful. I purchased the travel size two days ago because I was not sure if I would like it. Turns out that I immediately noticed my skin was brighter when I rinsed it off and with each day , each use my skin looks better each day. I only use it at night before I go to bed because of sone of the ingress in it and I do not like going bin the sun after I exfoliate. I did notice this morning that my skin is starting to peel( which is great). Its a very mild peel though , not very noticeable at all unless your looking at a magnifying mirror and light. Also my skin is self extracting. I noticed two pimples this morning that had actually extracted themselves so I finished the rest. Now, these pimples were not on ly face before , so what's happening is the dead skin is coming off my skin which is causing impurities to come to surface. Again, these are also very small pimples that are not noticeable unless you are looking at a magnifying mirror and lamp . If this continues with this outcome, I will be purchasing the bigger size",Orlando Florida,No,2,0

I use it 2/3x a week, dissolved with as little water possible and applied as a thinner kind of mask to clean skin, and let it sit for 15/20 min (I spritz my face with water 2-3 times during the wait to reactivate, or rub my face again with damp hands). Leaves my pores decongested and my skin smooth, soft and better able to receive serums/moisturizers/oils.

SO I gave this a try on a whim and I'm SO glad I did! It's truly changed my life. I also use this on my body and have been for a few months cause this stuff really lasts! What I do is use this every 3 days while I'm showering to make sure I really feel a good scrub. However, this is not harsh AT ALL. But I also don't mind the feel of a grittier product and this stands right in between. I love it!

I mix this with a gel cleanser or a cream cleanser depending on the time and year and if my face is oily or dry.

I have a lot of acne scarring and it has faded it and made my skin more radiant, to the point that I will go out without makeup without feeling self conscious. It gets rid of my dry patches and texture so my makeup goes on better too.

Recently i moved to a colder climate and realized my skin had these flaky dry patches on all of my healing pimples, and the clarisonic wasnt helping. Thats when i found this in the back of my drawer and decided to try again. You're supposed to massage it on your face for a full minute so the chemical exfoliant part kicks in, which i hadnt really done the first times i did it, so when i did it for the first time recently i realized this was my new holy grail. It delivers immediate results!!! My serums and moisturizer went on so smooth and immediately absorbed into my skin, and the next day i woke up with NO dry patches for the first time in months. I was SHOCKED. I dont use it daily, maybe 3 times a week when i dont use my clarisonic, but the difference is night and day.

I saw the trail size out of the corner of my eye and I just knew we were meant to be. I rushed home to ""consummate"" (AKA USE THE PRODUCT for the 1st time) our relationship. I took a shower to wash off and I'll admit my face felt soooooooo smooth. The weirdest thing happened when I looked in the mirror though...my cheeks were red with raised patches of bumps all over. This was within 5 minutes of washing it off. I knew I had made a mistake at that moment because I'm the color MOCHA in most foundation shades, and to see red on my dark skin was a cause for pause...I gave it to my teenage son and he's loving it. I'm glad he's have a great experience because I won't go within 1 foot of this product again. You hear me? Loud and clear? It's a NOPE for Dermalogica and I(whomp, whomp).","Orlando, FL",No,4,9

It lasts forever so don't let the price wig you completely out. I think it's expensive too, but at least they last a long long time bc it really only takes a little. I love that it is a natural product and how finely ground it is. It wipes off well with a wet wash cloth as opposed to some of the heavier exfoliants.

I decided to try this exfoliating powder because of my girl, JACKIE AINA. It's only been a few days and I'm already noticing a huge difference. While exfoliating pads are quick and easy, they just can't go deep into the pores. This stuff can. My pores look tiny!

The last time I touched tea tree oil was when it was in a shampoo used at a salon I went to. After I left I noticed my skin was itchy and a little burny as well as my scalp doing the same thing. I looked in my mirror and I had hives everywhere my hair had touched my face and neck. I have avoided it ever since. Though I use chemical exfoliants regularly, my friend insisted this was a product I had to try. Tea tree was waaaaaaay down on the Ingredients list so I decided to go ahead and buy the travel/trial size. OMG. I mixed a little of this with my normal water based cleanser, lathered up and cleaned my face as the second part of my double cleanse. It left my skin so soft and looking more smooth than what I had started with. I have continued to use it, sometimes mixed with another cleanser to add oomph or by itself I have sensitive and reactive skin and this physical exfoliant does not leave my skin inflamed...it is the only physical exfoliant that hasn't.

My skin is relatively clear and I get occasional breakouts. This caused me to get small pimples on my cheeks and jawline. Overall, I don't think this works for every skin type so just be careful.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Not sure I would buy again,"I have very sensitive skin that tends to be on the dryer side. I currently use an oil cleanser and noticed it wasn't quite working on my nose. I went in to find alternative options.

Before discovering this line I had tried MANY, but none have me the quick, beautiful results as dermalogica! The price point is high, but I appreciate the fast results!

I've never found anything that's helped with how oily my face is. No, my skin has not totally stopped being oily, but it's literally the only thing I've ever used that has made it much less oily! It also seems to be helping with clearing out my large pores. I'm a HUGE fan and would definitely recommend it to anyone with oily troubled skin!!!!!",Tennessee,No,2,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Fantastic,"I have incredibly sensitive, reactive, normal/dry skin...and I'll emphasize sensitive. It's ridiculous. I typically stay away from any form of physical exfoliation (also can't use Vitamin C, Glycolic Acid, or Benzoyl Peroxide) but I saw so many reviews on various sites about people with sensitive skin using this, so I thought I'd give it a try. We moved to a much dryer climate and my skin was actually flaking and I had to do something about it. I started with the mini size and have since bought two of the larger sizes. Make sure that you add enough water or it will feel a bit rough. I just pour a dime size amount in my palm, add a bit of water and rub my hands together and then gently rub on my face...I think the instructions say to do it for about a minute. My skin feels so soft and I have not had any bad reaction to it. I use it daily because it is so gently, but I could easily use it every other day or every couple of days. It just depends on your own preference. The container, ever the mini, lasted me longer than I thought it would.","Eagle, ID",Yes,2,1

This is worth every penny and so happy I finally got to try with my gift card I was given. Will last a while since its a powder that turns to paste once mixed with water in your hands.

When I wake up any redness is gone, acne is down to barely nothing (plus I haven't even gotten a hormonal breakout this last period since I started this product) and overall texture and smoothness is beautiful. The salicylic acid in the exfoilant is such a low % that you can even finish with a retinol product after if you want.

Trying to take care of my skin after buying a really nice Anastasia foundation but after application, my face still had flaky dry spots amd I was advised to use an exfolient to help that. Looking forward to those results after more use but right after first use, I'm impressed and feel like the cost is worth it.",Washington state,No,0,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Worked from the very first use,"I received the trial size of this product as my birthday gift this month. I was very impressed and will be purchasing regularly now. I usually use Clinique products, but this was incredible so I'll definitely be holding on to this one. I have combination skin and it works well on my oily areas without over-drying the rest. I must admit that I am a little disappointed that it costs so much. My routine is as follows: 1) I start in the shower. I wash my hair and body first to give the hot water time to steam open my pores. Then I wet my face and neck and use facial soap to cleanse. 2) After rinsing the soap, I apply this product per instructions. A little goes a LONG way with this. I gently massage it onto my face and neck for about 30-45 seconds. As I do so, I can already feel my skin getting smoother and softer. I've never had a product that makes such a drastic difference, especially on the very first use. 3) Immediately after rinsing, I go ahead and get out of the shower, and dry off all of my body except my face and neck. I apply toner to my face and neck, then moisturize with Clinique products as well. The end result is softer, smoother, younger-looking and younger-feeling skin. I can't help but keep touching my face to feel how smooth it is. It feels silky soft. My husband noticed the difference after the first use and he LOVES it. I've now used it 3 times and even the most stubborn blackheads and bumps that I get on my chin are gone. Can't see them or feel them at all. I will absolutely recommend this product to others.","Cleveland, OH",No,2,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Honest Review,I got this in the travel size for free for my birthday gift and they lady behind the counter told me she swears by it (I've heard that one before though lol). I use it and my skin is super soft! I have sensitive skin so I was a little worried about it but I had NO breakouts or rashes or anything from it! It left my pores looking amazing and my face has never been less oily before in my life. I added a little bit of moisturizer ( I'm obsessed with moisturizer lol) and my skin was glowing all day and my make up went on flawlessly. I've continued to do my routine with this included and didn't have any breakouts for my period (which I normally break out). I would 10/10 recommend to anyone! I totally understand it's a little on the expensive side but it's totally worth it.,"Olympia, WA",No,2,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Very impressive,"I got this as my birthday gift this month because I've been in need of a good exfoliant, and I've definitely found it. Even after just the first use there was a complete difference in my skin texture. My forehead and nose have been on the rough side for a few years now, and this product makes them feel so soft and smooth. A little product goes a long way, I'd say half a dime size. If you do accidentally pour more than you meant to like I did the second time, use the excess on your chest and neck. It works on the body too! There's a very subtle scent once it's turned into a paste, but the best way I can describe it is neutral. Not good or bad. There hasn't been any irritation or any kind of negative reaction when used in combination with my current skin care routine. The price tag is daunting, but with results like mine, it's worth every penny; at least to me. Will definitely purchase once the gift size has run out.","Snellville, GA",No,1,0

But my god after using this exfoliator a few times, it's like my skin changed completely! It's silky smooth and the redness is gone! I had always been embarrassed with the texture of my skin, to the point that I didn't like anyone touching me, but those insecurities are GONE. I can't stopped touching face! I have seen my hyperpigmentation lighten up, but that was after I used the product for 3 weeks and I have kept up with my weekly skin routine with other products and the fact that I've stopped picking at my skin, so I'm not sure how effective it's on discoloration.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Potential To Be Great For Everyone,"This was the birthday gift for February and I had been wanting to try it someday anyways. This reminds me a lot of the DHC Face Wash Powder. It makes my face feel SUPER soft after I use it and it really does help to brighten and clarify. I don't use it everyday though. I use it about every two-three days. I think if it is used every day on skin that doesn't have a lot of issues at first (if you're not having a breakout, if you don't have oily skin) or if you have dry and sensitive skin, I think it could really hurt. Everyday exfoliation seems silly from what I have been told about skincare and the skin cycle. Always listen to your body.","Madison, WI",No,2,1

The product has extremely fine grains. Be diligent to keep away from your eyes during use AND rinsing. I've had a grain of the exfoliant in my eyes before and its very uncomfortable. It got there during the rinsing phase. Just be careful. I LOVE the product.","Springboro, Ohio",Yes,1,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Okay but not my favorite,"Dermalogica has been hit or miss for me in the past. This microfoliant would be a miss but to be fair: I don't think any company makes microfoliants well because of its nature and structure. First off, microfoliants are created to be dry and most have some sort of physical exfoliant included. What usually ends up happening is: the product dries the skin out because it's too strong OR the humidity in the bathroom ends up solidifying the product inside the bottle over time. Plus side is: dermalogica's microfoliant did help improve my acne to a certain extent.","Paramus, NJ",No,0,0

Even though it is a microfoliant, it is surprisingly gentle on my skin, there wasn't any irritation or redness after use. My skin feels very smooth and looks brighter. I poured less powder onto my hand then suggested and that still was plenty of product, which is amazing because it will last me much longer. Overall this product is amazing and I am making it my skincare staple.","Detroit, MI",No,0,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,ANOTHER new staple in my routine!,"I was surprised to see it is just a powder. I have not tried anything like this before, but I know Dermalogica makes amazing products, so I'm very glad I decided to give this a try! I used a little too much water to activate it. Just use a few drops of water and go from there until you get your desired consistency. Even though I lost a little product, ended up getting a great quick facial out of it! Since this Daily Microfoliant is literally meant to be used daily, there is no need to overdo it. GENTLY rub your face for up to 1 minute, then rinse. After my first use, I had the softest skin, and my actives I always use actually stung a little. Don't be fooled by the Daily Microfoliant smooth texture, it is definitely an exfoliator!! I'm going to use this nightly to give my skin a perfect canvas for my PM routine. I'm not big on daily physical exfoliating, but this product might just change my mind. My skin feels so smooth and soft the next morning! I wish I had this product 20 years ago.",CA,No,0,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,An easy favorite,"As far as face scrubs go, this is easily my favorite one. I have oily skin and prefer a chemical exfoliant, but this does a great job when I want a physical exfoliant. It's very fine and gentle, but it leaves my skin soft and ready for the rest of my skin care routine.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Repurchase Forever,"Gifted by Dermalogica. I've purchased this item in the mini size at least 5 times now. The reason I buy a mini is because I don't want to risk not being able to take it with me when I travel! It's THAT good. I'm a sucker for a physics exfoliant, & this product is a combo of physical (rice bran) & chemical (papaya enzymes + salicylic acid) to gently exfoliate. You can add a small amount of water for a more textured paste consistency, or add more water for a thinner / more foamy texture - so a customized experience each time. My favorite hack is to add this to my favorite gentle cleanser! Overall my skin always feels smooth, soft, bright & comfortable after I use it. Never dry or tight! Which makes this a great product to use as part of makeup prep, for a smooth finish. I can't rave about this enough - so while this bottle was gifted, I've been a long lover of the daily microfoliant & think it's great for exfoliating & helping your skin stay glowy!",Washington,No,0,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,love this one,"I have now found my very favorite facial cleanser of all time! I have quite oily skin even though I'm in my early fifties, and have struggles for years to find a cleanser that does it all. This one is the one. My husband has even begun using it regularly as well. It cleans my skin thouroughly without being the slightest bit irritating. The product is a powder, and only a small amount is needed. It makes a nice foam, and even has a tiny bit of abrasiveness. Those are all things that work well for my oily, large-pore, non-acne prone skin. I use it both morning and evening prior to my skin care. Because of its powder form, it is also ideal for travel. If there was one small thing I have a ti y concern about, it would be that the dispenser must be handled with care in the shower, carefully not getting any water in the dispenser top when putting the product in your hand to use it. If you do this, it can clog a bit.","Houston, TX",No,0,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,i love dermalogica,"Honestly - dermalogica has been a total game changer. I am obsessed with their entire line. I love my esthetician at Ulta and we talked about my needs after my facial and this is something she recommended to me along with precleanse (IF YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THIS IS - YOU SHOULD BECAUSE ITS THE BEST). It's gentle and I feel like it will last me forever. The only reason I decided to write a review is after reading the con list. FIRST OFF - this is NOT a makeup remover. This is to exfoliate your skin. You should be REMOVING your makeup before you use this. If not - you're just rubbing your makeup into your pores. Also - if you don't exfoliate on a regular basis I wouldn't start using this every day. Although it's very, very gentle - so is your skin. Give your skin time to adjust and start adding this into your routine slow and be sure to follow up with a moisturizer. It is pricey but I have not found anything remotely this gentle before. To me, it's worth spending the money on this. I know it won't damage my skin and because I use it a handful of times a week it will last me forever. I also do not find it messy. You pour a little into your hand and add a little bit of water and then gently massage into your skin. I highly recommend this among a ton of other dermalogica products. It's worth the money to invest in your skin! This is a GOOD brand who doesn't add BS into their products. I will forever be obsessed.","Long Island, NY",No,5,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,My holy grail exfoliant!,"I use this product almost every day, it's gentle enough for daily use and doesn't irritate my sensitive/acne prone skin. When I purchased this I was looking for an abrasive exfoliant, something that would get the job done. The sales rep recommended this to me because of my acne, and said that an abrasive exfoliant would just irritate my skin. I was skeptical about this product because it's ""gentle"", however when I used it I found that my acne calmed down quite a bit and I've not had any new break outs since starting to use it. The smell reminds me of Aveeno oatmeal bath, it's not the best smell but there are no added fragrances so I really like that! I would recommend this over and over again! It leaves my skin feeling smooth and ready for makeup application.","Laurel, MD",No,0,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Best every day exfoliant,"This is the perfect exfoliant. The price is a little out of my range for the full size - but when I can afford it, I'm getting it! I've been using this product for years and I've found deals here and there (21 days of beauty, now they offer the smaller size, etc.). But when I'm actively broken out in acne I can use this to get rid of dry skin because it has salicylic acid and even though it gets rid of all my dry skin - the exfoliation isn't at all too-abrasive so it won't just open the breakouts and spread the bacteria like most exfoliators. A life saver. It doesn't smell so good - but it's not potent at all and it's only if I'm actively trying to smell it and I'd prefer that over a fragrance that harms the skin any day. Thanks dermalogica!",Indianapolis,Yes,0,0

I couldn't be happier with this product. I ran out for about 3 days a couple of weeks ago and within 48 hours noticed the difference in my skin.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Excellent Effective Product,I really feel I get results with this product. It is very pricey for what it is but a little goes a long way when using. I have purchased this several times now and it lasts for almost a year with regular use of 4-5 times a week. I just purchased the set of this with the precleanse oil that was available over the holidays and I keep the travel size around for trips. This gentle product leaves my skin very smooth and fresh and alleviates dry flakey patches. I prefer to use it in the morning prior to applying makeup as it makes foundation application smooth and flawless. Makes a big difference in the appearance of my makeup and brightens my complexion. I will probably try the new superfoliant as well but love how gentle and effective this product is. Never leaves my fair skin red or irritated.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,It's good but not great,"I bought this product because I wanted something more gentle to exfoliate my face with. I have combination skin and it does tend to get really dry even after I cleanse with gentle face cleansers. I first started to use this product twice or three times a week at the most and I did not notice a difference at all. Needless to say I was disappointed because so many people gave this exfoliant raving reviews. I decided to use it everyday to see if I would see a difference in my skin. I dampen my face, pour a half teaspoon on a little silicone scrublet face pad and start exfoliating. Half a teaspoon of product does go a long way and I feel like the exfoliant works better using the silicone facial pad than just your hands. After using it everyday, I can honestly say my skin does look brighter. It is gentle enough to use everyday but it can dry out your skin a bit. I like the product but I can't say that it's a miracle product or a life changing product. You will see results but perhaps not as drastic as you might think because of the raving reviews you read. I do plan on purchasing this product again for its gentleness most of all.","Rosenberg, Tx",No,5,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,not sure yet...,"I think I need more time with this product, but overall I feel good about it. I have super sensitive skin and use other Dermalogica products to combat that. The daily microfoliant is very mild-it's barely abrasive.

After years of struggling with acne, taking antibiotics, using harsh topicals, even undergoing a round of Accutane, it seemed like absolutely nothing was going to clear my skin. My forehead was greasy and bumpy with things that weren't quite blackheads or white heads while my cheeks and jaw were dry and developed deeper, bigger zits. I gave up on my dermatologist who wasn't helping and walked into Ulta. Within 2 minutes, the Dermalogica rep looked at my skin and recommended this product. I was skeptical that something that seemed so gentle could do anything, but she told me to start off using it every other day or every two days and I could potentially increase to every day use. Well, that's what I've done and seriously, my skin has never been brighter, smoother, clearer, softer, etc. This stuff is a little pricey, but it is a MIRACLE.

I use everyday and don't have to use a separate soap cleanser and my skin is clean yet not dried out. So good I bought a backup and then a full size (elsewhere since this price point is outrageous).

I've been wanting it for so long, and then my mom asked me what I'd like for my birthday, and she surprise me with this. Such a sad gift. My skin is combination/oily, for sure more on the oily side. My skin has been looking pretty darn good, but this winter has brought on some texture/patchiness I was hoping to correct. After I saw so many youtube makeup artists saying it helped, I was sold. This was the only thing I changed in my skincare/makeup routine was this product. My entire face is one entire rough patch, skin is flaking off, and my makeup wouldn't apply to my face after ONE USE. It looks TERRIBLE. It's so dry/flaky that it hurts to smile. I even diluted it pretty well with water, so there was no harsh scrubbing or exfoliating. I'm heartbroken my loving mother wasted her money, and also that my face looks THE WORST for my birthday events.","Redmond, Oregon",No,5,3

I love all the ingredients in it and I am using it every night after I remove makeup with a face wipe and wash my face. I apply wet paste on wet face with circular motions for one minute and then allow it to dry and leave on face for 3-4 minutes (as a quickie mask to whiten) then rinse off and continue with my PM routine.

It's meant to be mixed with water so that you can form a paste to exfoliate your skin with. The exfoliant bits are small but not mild. For me, this product actually has the perfect texture. It's not too harsh, but it's harsh enough that my skin feels shockingly smooth after usage. I love that the results are basically immediate. It's really improved my acne and the overall texture of my skin, too.","Blacksburg, VA",No,2,0

I actually like this one much more than the Tatcha one, because of the ingredients and of course, price.I don't typically use this every day, more like every other day or every two days, and it has improved my complexion over all. My skin isn't so red anymore, it gently exfoliates, which helps my oily skin/texture, and it brightens my face. I haven't used any abrasive scrubs in a long time since I started using this.

I took this person's word and switched to what they recommended - Dermalogica. Within 3 weeks of using this product, my face broke out so bad and I've been struggling to clear it up since. Early November 2017, I finally took back everything I owned of Dermalogica and switched back to C&C Morning Burst. 3 months later I'm finally almost clear again. I will never, ever recommend this brand or use it again.

Depending on the condition of my skin I'll use it anywhere from once a week (if I'm clear) to daily (if I'm breaking out). This stuff is waay more gentle than most exfoliants which honestly I found were making my skin worse from all the harsh abrasives. This microfoliant does none of that- it exfoliates smoothly and gently as often as you need without being harsh or feeling like it's stripping your skin... After I use it my skin feels smooth/soft/calm never irritated/tight/dry..

I got a sample of this as well as the calm cleanser and had the best skin I've had since my early 20s. I ran out of this and continued with the cleanser thinking that was the real heavy hitter (I kid you not when I say I've used SO many exfoliators I didn't think one could cause such a drastic change in my skin) but within a week of not having it, my skin went back to being dry, having huge pores, and looking tired as all get out, with a smattering of breakouts.

I like to note that this is coming from someone who does not have sensitive skin so to each there own, however in my end this product made miracles happen.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,I wanted to love but.....,I purchased a travel size and found the product amazing how a powder mixed with a few drops of water could turn into a foaming face wash that exfoliate well I started to notice pimples on my jaw line but ignored them and purchased another travel sized backup and that when it hit me like a ton of bricks after all it is the only new product I tried lately ( used twice weekly) so I tried it once a week with heavy moisturizing I AM STILL BREAKING OUT ON MY JAW LINE. 😔,sylvania georgia,No,1,2

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Horrible Reaction,"Bought the small bottle to give it a try and had a horrible reaction within a few hours of using this.

So sad, like an physical exfoliant and this seemed promising.","Boston, MA",No,2,3
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,It's just blah,"I needed a good exfoliator so I decided to try this out. It's different. It's a powder that you put on wet hands and rub it into your face. It definitely made my skin feel soft and clean but it didn't exfoliate at all. I think it could make for a good face wash but definitely not for exfoliating. I decided to go back to my exfoliating pads. I have pretty sensitive skin so I try to keep to my every day products the same.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Love!!!,"This was my first ever Dermalogica product I bought. I'm getting married June 2023 and I have always had sub par skin and have been wanting to change that! I started getting monthly facials and Dermalogica is the brand they use so I figured I should start there. The daily microfoliant is a game changer for people who want brighter, more even tone, and smaller pores. The only negative is the smell could be better, it kinda smells like rice (which makes sense since it is rice based). In a matter of a few months, I now own the Preclense, Special Cleansing Gel, Daily Microfoliant, and Intensive Moisture repair Moisturizer. If it's in your budget, make the switch to Dermalogica; you won't regret it!!!","Muskegon, MI",No,7,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Magic,So this is magic in a bottle. I use it twice a day. My breakouts have really decreased. Now it has a grit feel but it melts in your hand as you cleanse.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,"Good ingredients, yet average results!","This contains not only 'Papain' and 'Salicylic Acid' - two of my go-to ingredients I look out for when purchasing a new exfoliator, but several other very good ones too. To say I was looking forward to using Daily Microfoliant would be an understatement. I followed the instructions and used a small amount of powder mixed with water into a paste, and then massaged over my face for 1 minute before washing off. It worked fine, no irritation or adverse effect, even a degree of 'brightening', but at the same time it did not exfoliate properly as my skin felt somewhat bumpy straight after and not as smooth as it usually does post-exfoliation. Most of my clogged pores were still clogged. For comparison I can use St Ives or most other drugstore exfoliators and get much better results, at a fraction of the price. I think this may be one of those hit and miss products.

The texture is amazing! I count to 60 seconds while gently scrubbing in circular motions and it produces a lovely lather. When I rinse my face, my skin feels textureless, like glass! When I dry my face my skin is glowing, literally. I'll definitely be purchasing the full size as soon as I run out of this one.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Gentle calming exfoliator,"I was gifted this product from Dermalogica and Ulta in exchange for my honest review. I enjoyed using this daily microfoliant! It's a rice based exfoliator which I found to be wonderfully gentle. The key ingredients in this product are rice, oatmeal, salicylic acid, tea tree oil and papaya enzymes. These ingredients work to brighten, calm and keep skin clear. I am actually surprised to see tea tree oil on the ingredient list because I didn't detect any tea tree scent. If you are sensitive to tea tree, keep this in mind. I've been using this for 2 days in my PM routine after cleansing my face. The product is in a powder form and I pour about a dime sized amount onto the palm of my wet hand and rub until it turns into a paste. It's so cool to see it turn from powder to a paste just by rubbing with water! Once it turns into a paste, I massage it around my face and then rinse with warm water. It feels so calming when I'm massaging the paste. The faint scent of rice and oatmeal reminds me of baby food and that sweet calming scent of a newborn baby. After using this, my face feels very nice! It feels smooth and polished! While I don't notice any immediate significant brightening benefits, I do notice a slight improvement. More significant improvement probably requires longer term use.",NJ,No,0,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Use it after cleansing,"The skin is so soft and smooth after using this! But it is so important to follow the instructions - very important that you use microfoliant on *cleansed* skin. I didn't the first day I got it - used it right over emulsified makeup, and promptly got an inflamed pore from rubbing in the leftover makeup. So rule #1 - cleanse THEN exfoliate. After I learned my lesson and started using it as intended, it is simply amazing. The ""grains"" dissolve, so you don't end up over-exfoliating the skin, and the skin feels balanced and soft and smooth, not irritated or over-rubbed as with other mechanical exfoliators.","New York, NY",No,0,0

Feels nice on my face but not gritty, washes off easily and doesn't leave me feeling overly exfoliated or dry. I'm left with soft and smooth skin afterwards. I have a brighter more even complexion. Even makes makeup application go on smoother. Overall I enjoy and highly recommend!",TN,No,0,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Textured Skin Essential,"I received this gifted from Dermalogica for my honest review. I have oily, acne prone, textured skin and love using all types of exfoliants. The user experience of this is really new to me. It might feel cumbersome to find the perfect ratio of powder to water mixture but once on the skin it feels really effective. I especially love the lack of scent as that might bother people with sensitive skin. This really smooths out the skin and dislodges any whiteheads I don't notice, making prepping for foundation makeup really nice.","Los Angeles, CA",No,0,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Amazing product,"This is one of the best exfoliants I have ever used! I love that it is gentle enough that you can use it everyday. You activate the rice based powder with water which allows rice enzymes, papain and salicylic acid to polish your skin.

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Very gentle but leaves skin baby soft!,"I love Dermalogica and have heard good things about this product, so I wanted to give it a try for myself. For reference, I'm 42 and have dry/combo skin. It was super-easy to use, even for me because I tend to like to exfoliate in the shower. I've kept this in my shower the whole time and it hasn't gotten clumpy (I was worried it might with being kept in a damp environment). Just pour a little pile into damp hands, rub hands together, and rub on your face/neck/chest for a full minute. Don't skimp! It doesn't smell...great. It smells just like baby's first rice cereal for all of the parents out there, but the smell isn't awful and it doesn't linger after being washed off. I wasn't sure how well it would work because I expected harsher scrubbies in it and it was very creamy. After using my skin is baby soft every time! It's very gentle and it doesn't dry me out either. 100% recommend!","Jackson, TN",No,0,0

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Works Incredibly Well,"This is the 3rd bottle I've started using consecutively, so it is safe to say I genuinely love this product. I use it 2-3 times/week vs. every day because I am using Rx retinol + AHAs, so my skin cannot handle daily mechanical exfoliation, however this product is gentle enough for most people to use daily. One bottle of this if used 3 times/week will last you 1/2 a year. When you think about it like that, this is actually priced really well. I use this as part of the Dermalogica 3-step cleanse after the PreCleanse and Special Gel Cleanser, and have not looked back since I started. My skin is left texturally smooth without drying it out.","Portland, OR",No,0,0
daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Gentle,I love this product! It's an amazing and gentle exfoliant. My skin always feels soft after use! The best way and proper way to use this is to pour some in a bowl with a little water and whip it up into a froth and apply with a fan brush. Let's sit for 5-10 mins and it does all the work for you!

daily microfoliant,dermalogica,Skincare staple!!,"This gently foaming micro-exfoliant is a game-changer as far as I am concerned. Disclaimer: I do not experience skin sensitivity and have combo-dry skin, which means in the winter especially if I am not vigilant with my exfoliation my skin ends up patchy, dry, tight, and peely in all the wrong spots. This physical exfoliant is the first one I've tried that is gentle enough for daily use, yet effective in keeping the dry spots and peely skin at bay without any sign of irritation or over-exfoliation, like breakouts. I love using this in the shower to really soften up any dead skin before sloughing it off with this product. It comes in dry powder form and is activated with water, which makes it TSA-friendly as well. After each use, my skin looks and feels amazingly soft. Can't say enough good things about this one! *product gifted for the purposes of review","Washington, DC",No,0,0

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,AMAZING,In all honesty I an not great with skin care and have tried loads of products. My skin has been looking really dry and Dull. At first I wasn't sure what to expect with this product but I love it. It's a powder - which at first took some getting used to to get the right consistency - pour a small amount into my palm and add water and then massage on face for about a minute and the wash off thoroughly. My skin has been looking fabulous especially over the festive period which is crazy as I am prone to break outs (due to over indulgence!!). I have seen a definite difference in my skin and someone at work even asked if I had changed my make up (I haven't !). Love this and will definitely buy once my complimentary bottle runs out. The only slight downside I would comment on is the scent...but given that it's prettt natural ingredients it is probably a good thing that there is no artificial smell...FAB!,Glasgow,No,0,0

The grains dissolve easily and don't get under my contacts. It also doesn't dry out my skin - very important in winter. Cons: A CHARCOAL MESS! When washing at the sink, the black water stains everything. Use an old, dark towel. You can't use this scrub in the shower because the humidity makes it clump and clog the opening. I didn't find that it cleared my pores better than the original, nor better than other charcoal/pore cleansers. Luckily I bought this during an Ulta 21 Days Sale, so I paid half the price.

I made my husband and sister feel them to make sure I wasn't crazy. I've been using these products for three months now, and the scars are almost completely gone.

I don't really have issues with blemishes but I do need a good exfoliating product or I notice that my face can look kinda dull or feel dry and scaly, especially in the winter, so this product has been amazing!! It's a little intimidating the first time you use it- you have to wash your face and make sure it's dry, then wet your hands and carefully pour it into one hand (it pours fast so pour slowly) and it does get messy), then rub your hands in a circular motion to make a paste. Once you've got a good consistency just rub it in with your fingers then rinse. I had some left over the first time so I just rubbed the rest on my hands and it helped slough off dry skin I'm prone to get during colder months. It's an expensive product but I would buy it again.",Tennessee,No,5,0

If your pores turn black, let it be a lesson in how well you're rinsing your face. And of course, please don't snort the product. Put it in a mount hand and add some water to make a paste.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Amazing!,"I stopped exfoliating a long time ago because it makes my skin produce too much oil so I became afraid and was unsure of what products to use. I was actually recommended this product by the lady who did my eyebrow microblading since she noticed my skin had clogged pores and built up dead skin. I bought this since I trusted her advice and I am so glad I did. I don't use it daily but instead use it in combination a few times a week with my GoodieCo SuperCharged Trio Set. I first use my cleansing oil, then this product, then my brightening and moisturizing oils after and my skin feels AMAZING! I have also learned that finding the right exfoliating product will help your other skincare products work more efficiently. This product specifically has enzymes in it that break down the dead skin cells. I was advised to put this product on and leave for 10 mins then wash instead of washing immediately like the directions state. As with all exfoliating products you should test your skin's sensitivity to a product before you leave it on and don't scrub, be gentle! This product is kind of expensive but if you only use it a few times a week I think you get a pretty good amount for your money. Definitely worth it!","Houston, TX",No,5,0

It is easy to use. I don't notice a bad scent, so maybe I'll have to update in a few weeks.

Superfoliant made my skin flare up with redness and made it more sensitive for 2 days. I'm glad I tried it, but will be going back to the original microfoliant.

The scrub is soft and not super rough like some exfoliators tend to be on skin. I use it after my dermalogica cleanser and it makes my skin feel so smooth after using. For best results use the other brands routine (it's expensive but so worth it). I have actually had to buy two sets of this so I could give to my sister.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,So far I love it!,"I've been using this roughly 4-5 days a week for 3 weeks and I definitely notice a difference in texture and I'm a LOT less oily. I'm not sure if this is the ""holy grail"" for oily skin, but so far it's been fantastic. THIS IS IN POWDER FORM AND REQUIRES WATER TO ACTIVIATE IT! I didn't see that part until I watched a YouTube review after I'd ordered. If it feels too gritty just add a drop or 2 of water for a smoother texture. I don't have sensitive skin, but have had to skip a day here and there because my nose (sides of nostril area) gets a kind of raw/chapped feeling but that could be from a product combo issue. No regrets buying, it pairs well with the Dermalogica sebum clearing mask if you're super oily.","Dallas, TX",Yes,0,0

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Does not physically exfoliate. Disappointed.,"This exfoliant is way too mild. I was led here by raving reviews for the amount of physical exfoliation of this product. It should simply be called a charcoal treatment as it has near to nothing by way of physical exfoliant. As soon as it touches water, most of the powder disappears leaving what feels like three little pieces that actually scrub. All in all it's a nice product but I would not call it an exfoliant at all. I need real actual scrub with A LOT of physical exfoliators. I think this is meant for very sensitive skin/ skin that doesn't need a physical exfoliant.",Rocky Mountains,No,2,0
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,True wonder product,"In my life there have been 3 major innovations for my skin that made a difference everyone could notice and this product is one.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Eh,I loved every dermalogica product I had used before this so having dry skin I was excited to try this. It's a no for me. Not as moisturizing as I would've hoped and I don't think it really even cleansed that well as the pores on my nose were huge. The cleaning gel from this brand works much better for my skin. I use that with the microfoliant and I use the preclense prior. That's the best face cleaning routine for me. I also recommend if you're reading these reviews because you have dry skin to get the skin smoothing cream from dermalogica because that is the most moisturizing thing I've ever used on my face. Also the skin hydrating booster. I mix them and I never have dry skin problems even in the winter.,"Merrillville, IN",No,0,0

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Review from an esthetician,"As an esthetician I know not all products are going to spell like roses and cupcakes. Most higher end and medical grade products don't because we all know fragrances aren't are friends when it comes to our faces... with that being said, has anyone here been to a zoo? Or inside an ape house? Because when I'm telling you, the first slather of this on my face I felt like I walked right into the doors of the ape house at the zoo. Smelled like a full on face of ape s... I mean, I honestly don't think it could come any closer to that smell if it tried. I don't care if my face felt soft after(which is the only reason it got two stars) , there's so many products that can do that and have additional benefits that don't smell so horrendous.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,"This is better, this is what I need!","I probably would not have written a review, but I had results right away and was amazed. Every time I get a facial they tell me I haven't been exfoliating enough. I just got a Derma plane a few weeks ago where it seemed like they took off half an inch of skin - this product is very similar to a dermaplane!!! Of course it's not a the actually shaving off of the skin but I mean I left it on for a pretty long time because I got distracted and when I washed it off my skin was tight, and had a new glow to it. My skin feels pretty close to what it was after my derma plan a few weeks ago my skin was very exfoliated. This product REALLY WORKS I have been using the microfolient for years now, but I do not use it often enough to notice any difference. This super folient is like getting an exfoliation facial. I guess I will finish the microfolient I have and try to use it more daily - would hate to waste it - the microfolient can be used daily but this super folient is probably too strong. I would not use it every day, but perhaps I could use it once per week? In winter this could make the skin dry, but definitely in summer this will help. I have skin damage on the top of my forehead. So this completely addressed that. I will probably use this superfolient every 1-2 weeks. I have combination skin.

Somedays there was no need for extra moisturizer even! I have read some other reviews on this product and people were comparing this formula to an older formula that Dermalogica had.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,"First Dermalogica product I've tried, I love it!","I've actually never heard of Dermalogica before trying the Intensive Moisture Cleanser. So far I love it! I have used so many different products to wash my face, each time I run out of one I seem to buy a new one that I've never tried before. I have touchy skin. I don't usually suffer from breakouts but I have a pretty uneven, sometimes red skin tone, and very dry. Some facial cleansers I've tried give me what I call a ""skin beard"" where I usually wash the hardest, around my mouth and under my nose. Dry flakes of skin, enhanced by foundation! It's awful. I'm so happy so far I haven't experienced that with this cleanser! The cleanser is really creamy feeling. I wear a 24 hour Loreal foundation that even after washing, when I use toner on a cotton pad, makeup still comes off on the pad. I have not had that happen with this cleanser! My face gets completely clean! I do not use a waterproof mascara so I can't speak on how well it removes waterproof mascara, but I do use the cleanser on my eyes and it removes my Wander Mile High Club mascara incredibly well and completely. I have not woken up with raccoon eyes after using this cleanser. It's done wonders for my dry skin, my skin actually feels soft to the touch, something I haven't felt in a while. Definitely feels like a high quality, expensive facial cleanser. I'm very pleased with it so far and would absolutely buy it again as well as try other Dermalogica products.","Virginia Beach, VA",No,0,0

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Nice gentle cleanser,"This is a very nice gentle cleanser. It comes out of the bottle in a milky smooth form. It is very very gentle on the face. It feels really good when you are cleansing with it. It washes off smoothly with no residue left. My skin felt very clean afterwards. For most, this is probably enough. But for me, the reason I wanted to try this cleanser is for the intense moisture. While my skin felt wonderful after using it, I had to put moisturizer on right away. After about 30 seconds, my skin was dry again. I do have pretty dry skin so that is why I gave it 4 stars because it would probably be great for normal skin. I would definitely recommend this to my friends.","Cypress, Texas",No,0,0

This super foliant feels like it really cleans deep vs. the micro that still feels good but not as super. I've been this using this product for about a week now and my pores are smaller and cleaner than ever. And my texture has reduced. Smell isn't as bad as other reviews say, and it's pretty natural.

I was mild, foamy, hydrating, and left my skin feeling clean and refreshed. I tend to get super dry skin if my face wash is too harsh, but this is gentle enough for me to use day AND night and not have an issue with dryness. I know a lot of the complaints were from people saying it didn't hydrate enough BUT you should be using a moisturizer after you wash regardless of what wash your using.

It was hard to tell how much of my makeup it removed though, because I didn't see any pigments washing off in the sink. It did look like my face was free of makeup though. After using this cleanser, my skin felt plump and not dry and tight. I like using this cleanser especially after I have used a peel because it's very mild. The texture of this cleanser is on the thicker side, so I would emulsify first in your hands. Also, for those who are sensitive to scents, I didn't notice any scent and I think this would be great for sensitive skin.","New York, NY",No,1,0

Thankfully, I've now been introduced to Dermalogica's new Intensive Moisture Cleanser and that 'tall order' has just been met, because this cleanser is absolutely wonderful! Although it's great for all skin, it really tackles dry skin beautifully by hydrating and replenishing while it cleans. I'm not entirely sure how Dermalogica accomplished this, but thanks to this ingenious and innovative formula, my skin looks and feels clean, soft & supple, as well as radiant! I only need a small dollop of this rich and creamy cleanser to get a thorough clean each time. In addition to the excellent performance of this skincare product, the science and ingredients that make up this cleanser are just as impressive! This skincare formula does the dirty work of cleaning thoroughly while working simultaneously to protect the lipids and proteins in our skin from being stripped away! That's what makes this skincare cleanser stand apart from other cleansers, in my opinion.

That is until Dermalogica's new Intensive Moisture Cleanser came along! Needless to say...I'll be stocking up on this wonderful skincare product! I also love that this formula is packed with nothing but goodness for your skin from coconut butter to murumuru seed butter and more!

I've been using this cleanser for over a week now and my skin has noticeably improved just in that short period of time. My skin just looks and feels healthier altogether, not to mention very clean....obviously! Another added bonus...a little goes a long way!

Twice last week I left the house without putting on my normal moisturizer because my skin felt so soft and hydrated. I didn't notice until later in the day that I had forgotten when I realized I didn't have any SPF on. The scent to me smells green like fresh cut plants and a bit citrusy. I don't mind it.

It does more than just scrub the dead skin, it leaves skin texture really soft & smooth. I alternate days between Daily Microfoliant & Daily Superfoliant, because I like them both. Once a week, I use the Sebum Clearing Masque (sometimes just on nose & chin) and follow with Daily Superfoliant to deep clean the stubborn clogged pores. I can't believe Dermalogica has TWO exfoliants that are perfect! Please don't change ingredients of the products we love, and we WILL keep coming back!","Santa Barbara, CA",No,3,1
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Helped my dry skin,I've been using this product for a few weeks now and I can say that it has really helped my dry skin. I use it morning and night. The fragrance is not what I expected because it has somewhat of a medicine smell. Other than that I think the product works well and keeps my face from drying out. I was aware of this product line before and I would recommend it to others. I think it works better than most facial cleansers I've used in the past because my skin is not dry anymore. It doesn't really lather up but I don't think it's supposed to.,Morgan City Louisiana,No,0,0

This cleanser smells nice, with a light orange scent. It is more creamy than foamy and has a pretty thick consistency. It felt moisturizing while I was using it and rinsed clean. My face felt nice and soft after, not stripped of moisture like it does with some cleansers. I prefer a bit more lather in my face cleanser. Creams always feel heavier and like my face isn't quite as clean as it could be. I didn't dislike this cleanser, but I would not go out of my way to purchase it in the future.",NM,No,0,0

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Nice gentle cleanser that is non-drying,"I received a sample of this product in exchange for writing a review. I had never heard of Dermalogica Intensive Moisture Cleanser before trying it, but found it to be very high quality. This is a non-foaming, gentle cleanser that does not strip or dry your skin. It has some nice moisturizing ingredients, but I'm not sure how much they help in a rinse-off product. I am deducting one star for fragrance. It contains natural fragrance from a variety of citrus and herbal ingredients, but that doesn't mean people can't be allergic or sensitive to those oils. Because you rinse it off, it was not a problem for me personally. However, I dislike fragrance of any kind in skincare because it does not add to the efficacy of the product and it can be irritating. I found this to smell very herbal, like rosemary and sage.","Phoenix, AZ",No,0,0

Do not use more than 2 pumps, it will be way too much if you do since the cleanser is potent. I have extremely dry skin so I am constantly looking for the best moisturizing cleansers, serums, lotions and even makeup. The first time that I used this product my first thoughts were how moisturizing it is and how it effectively and efficiently removes makeup without leaving a residue like some cleansers do. I also want to mention that I wear long stay foundation, lipstick and waterproof mascara. dermalogica intensive moisture cleanser works extremely well to quickly and efficiently take it off. Like mentioned before, it only takes at the most 2 pumps. If you use more than 2 pumps it will make your skin greasy. Since using this cleanser I have also found that I do not need to use as much moisturizer or serums since the cleanser itself is so moisturizing. I also want to recommend only using once a day.

It was fairly thick, and took a little extra time rinsing it off my face. I did notice an immediate clean feeling, but not an immediate moisturizing feeling.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Good job at removing makeup,"I have dry skin so I was pretty interested in trying this new Intensive Moisture Cleanser from Dermalogica. When using it, I noticed that it is indeed very moisturizing - the consistency is more like a moisturizer (it's a white cream), and not what you would expect from a cleanser. It has no added fragrances, but it has a herbs/plants scent - not good, not bad, just okay. It did a good job at removing makeup - I used a makeup remover wipe after using this cleanser just in case and it came back practically clean. However, I felt it did dry out my skin a little bit right after using it - which is not exactly a problem, since I applied moisturizer right away and the dryness feeling was gone. I might incorporate this into my routine, but I'm not 100% sold yet considering price point.","Vancouver, WA",No,0,0

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,You are missing out!,"I absolutely LOVE this product! Ever since I became a licensed Esthetician I have been able to try hundreds of products and this is by far one of my favorites for a daily exfoliant. This is the older sister product compared to the Dermalogica Daily Microexfoliant. I have learned over experimenting with this product it is best if you wet your hands first before you pour a DIME size amount into your hands. Rub your hands together to create a foam like consistency. If your hands are too wet it will cause the exfoliant to become too runny. If your hands are not wet enough the product will be too thick and grainy which can cause irritation. I have acne, hormonal skin that causes me to break out a lot and this product really helps keep it at bay. I would suggest exfoliating at night and if you have active acne make sure not to scrub intensely because it will cause it to be worse or be more irritated. Also, hint hint it WILL cause your skin to feel VERY dry after because its an exfoliant (whaaaaaaat... That's crazy, I know) Make sure you apply a serum and moisturizer afterwards to put hydration back into your skin.",Indiana,No,5,0

If the previous reviews have scared you away, I encourage you to give it a shot. You never know what will work for your own skin. I give it 5 stars!","San Diego, CA",No,4,0

I used it after precleanse and special cleansing gel, as I usually do with my daily microfoliant. I don't know what went wrong.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,My skin feels GREAT after use...but I noticed breakouts,"I received a set of dermalogica superfoliant, multi-vitamin power recovery mask and dynamic skin recovery cream from a friend as a gift. I have never used this brand before and as always, felt bit skeptical about it. In any case, I gave it a try. First I used the superfoliant which has terrible smell (not gonna lie) but that's probably b/c it is natural, without all the 'extra chemicals' so I was fine with it. My face felt super smooth and clean. I then applied the multi-vitamin recovery mask which went on smooth but then my face started to burn, really badly so I had to wash it off. I figured, ok - let me apply that recovery cream and then all heck broke loose. My skin was RED and very irritated so had to wash it all off with water which did help. I tried the multi-vitamin recovery mask on its own few other times as well as the dynamic skin recovery and unfortunately not only did it irritate my skin but I noticed break-outs. I don't remember the last time I broke out like this. Bottom line - I've read and heard great things about this brand but it really depends on your skin type and how it may react to the products. Unfortunately it did not work for me. I will finish using the daily superfoliant but probably won't be purchasing add'l one. My suggestion is get a sample and give it a try for few days.",Chicago IL,No,0,0

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Burns!,I used this for the first time in the shower. As soon as it touched my skin it was hot and started to burn in certain areas. I rinsed it off and my face was red and blotchy. I was told by a friend that maybe it was bc I was in the shower. Not sure how that is relevant so I waited a few days and tried again. It burned! I felt like my pores were bleeding they were stinging so bad. Now my face is peeling in the areas where my face had burned. Not compatible with my skin type at all. Which is strange bc I don't have sensitive skin.,Houston,No,0,4
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,"Buy it in large, now.","I've been using this product for nearly a year and I am OBSESSED. I use it 2-3 times a week to remove any dirts or pollution in my skin and it leaves it feeling soft, smooth and glowing... I feel so fresh-faced after using this and my skin's never looked or felt better! It's a perfect scrub because it's not too harsh on the skin whereas some can be quite intense. Do yourself a favour and spend a bit extra and get the large bottle (with any of their products). Worth every cent and will last you a very long time (still on my first).","Melbourne, AUS",No,2,0

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Highly recommend,This might be really gross but during the winter my skin peels and the exfoliator does a great job of scraping away the skin and giving it a really nice deep clean without putting microtears into my skin for more breakouts.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,It's ok,"Definitely makes your skin super soft but would make my skin super sensitive and breakout for a few days after.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Happy accidents,"I love the Daily enzyme Microfoliant the original. Never had a problem using it. Ran into Ulta and was in a super rush. Grabbed this Microfoliant with charcoal by mistake, a bit taken back by the size and the price when I pulled it out of the bag... it was a grab and go shopping trip. I love this wash so much I will not be without it. I am using differen gel (sp?) and this and the other Microfoliant are gold to my skin. It's important to use a light Microfoliant when using retinal. With the comparison. I enjoy the charcoal much more. Yet I'm very upset that you can't give me more than what is provided. And I am a person that will spend that extra coin for a product that works. I use this every other day and in between their cream Microfoliant wash, when not using the enzyme wash. So... this is a keeper. Ladies hydrate hydrate then hydrate some more. I have no problems with drying.",Ohio,No,0,0

But then I used the product and it has that nice tingly enzyme feel, has some scrub to it (although it does dissolve pretty quickly), and washes off easily.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Immediate results,I was exposed to this product by my aesthetician and the results are nothing short of astonishing. Each product I try seems to positively increase the quality of moisture and firmness in my skin. I tried it first as a sample and then immediately ordered from dermalogica - it's that impactful. First - be aware of the concise instructions do you do not waste it. Second - cup your wetted hand (be conservative) and then add the powder to the minimal water and then it forms a foaming paste that expands upon contact with water. If you need to add a bit more water; do so after the initial paste is made because otherwise you get a runny consistency that is more difficult to apply to your face. Third - don't forget your neck. You'll be amazed at the elimination of crepeyness and increase in smooth texture. This is similar in texture to charcoal tooth powder or a few other cleansers that come in powder form. THAT BEING SAID - this is far more effective in that it changes texture and seems to be more penetrating and effective than other fine milled powders I've tried. It's revolutionary in its form and it's even more revolutionary in its results. I follow up with dermalogica sleep cocoon at night and a few other dermalogica products for brightening and eye area. I will never be without this product. Last - i've been using this with my power effects Clarisonic for firming and it is a perfect transforming companion to that sonic cleansing method. It's great with regular cleansing or any manual or sonic brush.,"Denver, co",Yes,5,1
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Fresh and tight!,"I use this product every morning as part of my facial routine. I have been strictly an Arbonne product user, but I thought I would give this product a try after my exfoliator ran out and I needed something ASAP. This product looks a little messy (and can be), but it is worth it. After you apply and rinse off your skin feels tight (but not dry) and clean. I still use Arbonne after I use this super exfoliant, but I may start switching over. The only ""downside"" to the product is the trial and error of how much powder you need and if you accidentally pour too much out it's a little difficult to put everything back.","Chula Vista, CA",No,0,0

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,I love this product!,"I had been waiting until my Daily Microfoliant ran out to be able to try this. I wondered if I would like it as much as the microfoliant, and I am very happy I made the switch. I think this product does a better job of exfoliating and my skins stays soft and smooth longer so I don't feel like I have to use it daily. I can't say for certain it doesn't also have to do with the fact I also started using the new vitamin C boost serum at the same time, but overall I'm very happy since I started switching over to the Smart Aging line.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,It gives me pimples,"I am caucasian, with combination skin (oily t-zone) I switched from Daily microfoliant to Daily superfoliant. Well, I used both (not simultaniously of course) almost every day and I did not notice any difference between the two, but Daily superfoliant gave my skin pimples. I started to use it twice a week, however now I do not see any results since it is not a routine anymore. Gentle skin exfoliant works much better twice a week and there is no need in Daily superfoliant. Both powered exfoliants however even the skin, make it look healthier if used every day. I also have pigmentation after pregnancy, but they did not improve it.","Almaty, Kazakhstan",No,0,0

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Best immediate transformation,"My Dermalogica aesthetician gave me a sample and I had already been wowed by their other products to the degree I've dumped my other luxury products for this line — it's a zillion times more impactful and effective. The first time I tried this powder it reminded me how much I love a fine powder to paste product and the ease with which you can use very little and be conservative with the amount you utilize. I could not believe the ceramic smoothness to my skin when I began to rinse it off. My skin felt astonishingly smooth and poreless and BABY SKIN CUSHY and plumpened. It rinses easily and has an almost foamy expanding texture to it when added to water. I purchased it immediately the next day after trying and it's probably my favorite product so far. Magical. And I've tried every product out there that says it will create smoother, more resilient skin. Can't live without it. You'll be shocked - just like I was.

But now that I'm in my 30's, I have adult acne and hormonal acne, texturized skin and large pores and I had been using proactive for a while but that never did anything so I decided to just go ahead and try it and I'm so glad I did! I've changed my whole skin care routine, using oils, hylaraunic acid, and adding dermalogica superfoliant and cleanser to my routines and I think it makes a huge difference. I have oily skin and my skin is not as oily as it used to be.","Deltona, Fl",Yes,2,0

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Not worth the price,"Honestly, I don't see a difference in my skin at all. If anything, it made my skin worse. This was recommended by the Ulta Esthetician and I think they only try to sell you dermalogica products to get commission or something. This product is way overpriced and the results seem to be only temporary. It is very irritating and the esthetician said it would help with my acne and uneven texture but it doesn't remove blackheads or whiteheads. Yeah, it leaves my skin smooth and clean looking but only right after I use it. By the next day my skin looks just as before. Maybe for my skin type, the daily microfoliant would of been a better fit because of the salicylic acid in it but I am nursing and my doctor said to stay away from that ingredient :/",Colorado,No,1,0

A little goes a LONG way with this product. I bought the small 0.45 oz to test it out, and it has lasted for quite a while.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,New favorite,"I bought this after a recommendation from the esthetician (sorry if spelled wrong) at ulta. I usually just buy drug store products but am trying to start getting better quality products for my skin. I bought the smaller bottle because i wanted to try it out before spending so much for the full size bottle. I just used it for the first time and im in love! My face had never been so smooth. I did quickly realize a difference between this and what i normally use. First of all i am used to scrubbing kind of hard when i exfoliate so thats how i started off with this product but i quickly realized i needed to be gentle when i started to feel a bit of a burning sensation. I let up on how much pressure i was applying and continued to exfoliate very gently...no more burning. I expected that since i had to be so much gentler to avoid burning, that it would not exfoliate as well...i was wrong. This made my face feel a thousand times smoother than anything I've used before. I did find it to be a little drying so i applied a moisturizer right after rinsing and drying my face. My tips to anyone using this product is to be super gentle, you dont need to put a lot of pressure to get deep exfoliation with this product...i massaged it onto my face very lightly as if i were applying moisturizer...it works well and burning can be caused by ""scrubbing"" too hard. And i recommend moisturizing right after. I think its a fantastic product and have already recommended it to my sister and sister in law. I will definitely be buying this from now on.",Flint Mi,No,0,0

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Phenomenal,"Having sensitive skin isn't easy when shopping for products but the Daily Superfoliant was incredibly gentle and accommodating for an exfoliator. It's not the cheapest of products you'll find on the market and some may consider this out of their budget. That's probably my only critical point about this product. Is it worth the splurge? 100%. If I could say that you could spend your money elsewhere on something similar at a cheaper price, I would. Here's where Dermalogica wins.

I use this after the cleansing gel when all my makeup is off to really clean my skin of all the build up.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Changed my skin for the better,"The results for me were instant and excellent. My skin was immediately so, so much smoother after the first use and continues to improve in quality the longer I use the product. The appearance of black heads and clogged looking pores has really reduced - the improvement is particularly visible around my nose where I normally have issues. I find that so long as I am stringent with using plenty of hydrating serums and moisturisers, the exfoliator does not cause my skin to dry out and hasn't lead to an eczema breakout thus far. Although I did find that I had a breakout of spots around my chin and forehead when I tried to use it daily (a common side effect of over exfoliating). I'm not sure whether I was just being too vigorous with my massaging or whether my skin is too sensitive for daily exfoliants. However, reducing usage to every second day has cleared this problem up nicely. I use it on freshly cleansed skin by carefully tipping a small amount of the charcoal coloured powder into wet hands, rubbing them together then mixes the powder into a slightly foamy paste. I then massage this in circular motions to my face, avoiding the eye area, for approximately a minute. To finish up - rinse with warm water and pat dry I'll definitely be repurchasing when this runs out (if it ever does - it is lasting for ages!). I'm especially concerned about the effect of pollutants on my skin given that I live in a busy city centre so for me Daily Superfoliant is an absolute win.

Regardless of the packaging, the dusting comes out super quick and doesn't tell you how much to mix with the water to create a paste. Even though it did feel like it got deep down into my pores to clean, I can't say that this product was very soothing, or non-irritating.

The powder like texture was actually easier to use than I expected and it spread nicely across my face when I mixed it with warm water. The only difficulty I found was making sure all of the product was off of my face as the grainy powder sometimes got caught but that problem was soon solved after using a wipe.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,didn't agree with my skin type,"Unfortunately, as much as I loved all the other products that I received in my Dermalogica VoxBox from Influenster, this product did not agree with my skin at all. My skin type is very oily however, it is super sensitive and after putting this on my skin it began to become very hot and stingy! I have experienced this with other exfoliants so it may just be that I am alergic to something within these types of products. Although saying that it didnt agree with my skin, after washing this product off my skin felt amazing over the next few days!",Northern Ireland,No,0,0
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Definitely would buy again!,I've been using this product for over a month now! It's made a real difference to my skin.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Great skin refresher,"I feel this product really does scrub the skin well and gets rid of any dirt and excess oil. It smells a bit odd, but that's just the natural ingredients, and it makes up for it in its results. It's a great daily face wash, I feel it does more than my regular face wash especially if I really massage it in.",London,No,0,0
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,I'll never be without it now!,"I thought initially that this product would be a bit of a gimmick and that it'd be a pain to use and I wouldn't end up using it daily as suggested. How wrong was I? This product has changed my skin for the better and I will never ever be without it again. It is gentle on my skin and feels amazing to use. My skin is now smoother and softer than it has ever been and it has cleared up some of my under-skin bumps that I was suffering with. The product can be a little messy to use and took a while to get used to. You only need a little of the powder and mixed with some water it creates a paste. Massage into the face in circular motions for one minute and then I usually remove it with a muslin cloth and hand-hot water. It honestly feels like a pamper session each morning! I do find I can use it daily, but I know some people with more sensitive skin than myself may need to use it every other day. In short, I think this product is absolutely brilliant and I will never be without it! *This product was received free from Influenster for testing.",St Albans,No,0,0

I've heard so many raves about Dermalogica skincare products and this one did not disappoint. First of all, there isn't anything on the market quite like this! It comes out as a grey/charcoal powder and when mixed with water it transforms into a foamy exfoliant. I usually massage it in for about 1-2 mins, rinse and follow with my regular skincare routine. I find it great for all skin types. Very very awesome exfoliant, leaves my skin so silky soft , no dry patches and the next day my foundation goes on so smoothly. Would definitely repurchase once finished and already recommended to my friends !",London,No,0,0

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,A fun product for the old routine!,"I was so intimidated by this product! At receiving it and opening it I was so surprised by how unique it was that I did put it off for a few days but eventually gave in and tried it! The powder part of this product makes exfoliating my skin a bit more fun and less routine-like and is a great addition to my routine that I use it a few times a week. So far it has been good for my skin, it leaves it tight and clean. I look forward to seeing how it keeps working. *I received this product for free for testing*",London,No,0,0

This leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft, smooth & supple without any dryness or irritation. My skin has been especially dry/dull this winter & I've been having to exfoliate almost daily instead of my usual 3 times a week & needed something quick & gentle & this product is exactly that! I'll be ordering the full sized bottle bc I don't think I can live without this product!",Brooklyn NY,No,0,0
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Perfect for acne-prone skin.,"This product is very unique, it is a dry exfoliator that turns into a paste once added with water. This is a lovely fun edition to my skincare routine as it's very fun to make the paste etc. However, I do feel as though the packaging could be re-designed as it's easy to loose product from the way it pours. I have acne and this wasn't too heavy or abrasive for my skin, it didn't cause/irritate any further breakouts but left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. This is lovely to revive your skin at the end of the day, a good way to cleanse your skin whilst still be able to ""feel"" the product doing something. I did find that this minimised my pores and this was gentle enough for me to use everyday! Something I've never been ale to do with an exfoliant before. I'm unsure about the environmental claims however, I will vouch that this did make my skin look and feel CLEAN! I was sent this product for free for review purposes.",North East,No,0,0

My makeup glides on after like I had the skin of a 5 year old! No joke! Now for the nerd science bit that I love!!.... The Active ingredients are the stars of the show, Enzymes, Alpha Hydroxy Acid, Binchotan Charcoal purifies the skin, helping to adsorb environmental toxins from deep within the pores, while Niacinamide, Red Algae and Tara Fruit Extract help guard against the damaging effects of pollution. I didn't think I could stop using my AhA liquid exfoliator but have found a serious replacement if not bettet!!

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,The unicorn of cleaners!,"I don't love many cleansers but this is somewhat magical. It's the unicorn of cleaners. I received this product once in my libertys advent calendar (travel size) and once as a complimentary sample. You first start by pouring some powder into your hand. I'm not gonna lie, it looks like ash and first time around I didn't hold out much hope. You add a few drops of water and turn it into a grey paste. Now this is where the magic happens. It starts to foam and bubble a little and you smear it all over your face/ neck then give it a gentle massage. I add a little more water if it doesn't glide smoothly around the visage. Rub for around a minute, you'll feel the dead skin melting away, and rinse off for baby fresh skin. I'm normally very dry between my eyebrows and forehead and this really did remove the yuck and freshen my skin right up. As a bonus my moisturiser sunk in beautifully.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Really smooth & real results,"When it comes to exfoliants and chemical peels, I have tried so many which never live up to their claims. The Daily Superfoliant does exactly what it says, producing the softest, smoothest skin of your life and visibly reduces the appearance of pores and Black heads. Using this exfoliant is fairly easy, the salt shaker type packaging needs a steady hand and be careful not to use too much product as your skin might not be able to handle it. I can't quite use it daily as it dries my skin out, I have combination skin which is on the sensitive side, however 3 times a week is all I need for a visible improvement in my complexion. Friends and family have noticed and my makeup applies so well afterwards. At first I found my skin was quite sore when applying with a stinging sensation but it quickly got used to it and it's now a staple in my weekly routine. The smell is very organic, earthy with a hint of sulphur but it's not overly strong and disappears once you wash it off - it's totally worth it for silky skin believe me! Definitely tone and moisturise afterwards and if you do this each morning before you apply makeup, you will have the more flawless foundation application of your life. It you're on the fence try out the travel option as it's cheaper but believe me you won't be disappointed.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,I really love this product,"I love how innovative this product is- don't be put off by the fact it's not your 'usual' type of exfoliater.. it's better. You only use about half a teaspoon and rub together to make a sort of paste which you use on your skin after cleansing. It gets rid of all makeup, dirt and pollution leaving your skin baby soft and clean. I haven't had any spots or breakouts since using this and I will definitely be buying this when I am finished with the tub I have now. If you want super soft, glowing, youthful skin that's free from ageing & pollution then this is your go to!",Glasgow,No,0,0
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Everyday Exfoliant,"Finally an exfoliator fit for everyday use! I use this pretty much everyday and absolutely love it. It's gentle enough, isn't rough on the skin and doesn't strip the skin of it's natural oils. My pores are barely visibly, my skin is glowing and it hasn't caused any breakouts (which is a massive plus for someone with sensitive, acne prone and very oily skin). I occasionaly mix this with the cleansing gel for an extra deep cleanse and I couldn't recommend it more! Love the packaging and a little really does go a long way!",London,No,0,0

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Great for textured skin,I have acne prone and textured skin. But after using this my skin felt so soft and smooth. My make up applies so much better now too.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,i would buy this product again,"i used this product for the first time tonight. i started with pre cleanse then went in with special cleansing gel. i finished off with the superfolient, well wow. what an amazing product. from it changing from a powder to paste with a little water i applied it to my skin, its not ruff at all on my skin. i wasnt sure of the smell at first but i just ignored it and followed on with the product. once i rinsed it off my skin has never felt so smooth. i dont normally review things after a one time use but i had too my skin feels amazing. i finished off with the skin smoothing cream.",elgin,No,0,0
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Love it,"This is such a unique skincare product. I love the simple yet elegant packaging. The superfoliant powder itself is probably the most thrilling part of this. A first glance, it looks somewhat granular and slightly rough in texture, yet upon touch, the powder instantly flattens to a silky chalk like feeling. Although it looks and feels similar to a chalk powder, it surprisingly is not at all dry like a chalk powder! Even when touching it in its dry state, the powder does not feel drying! The most exciting part is adding water to the powder in the palms of your hands. The powder instantly becomes milky and extremely smooth to the touch! When used with a cleaning brush or sponge, the face wash creates a very rich and bubbly lather. However, when used only with your hands, it has less of a bubbly lather and more of a cleansing milk texture. I use it every other night to gently cleanse/exfoliate my skin. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth without feeling dry at the end. It helps maintain soft and smooth skin with light and gentle daily exfoliation. I have developed no dry flaking patches while using this product in my current routine. There has not been a time since using this face wash where I felt my skin was becoming more oily or drier. To me, this signifies that my skin's pH is balanced well. When it comes to antioxidant benefits and vitamin benefits, it can be hard to tell. However, based on my skins overall appearance and feeling, I would say this cleansing does everything it claims! My skin looks healthy, feels smooth to the touch, has less clogged pores, and overall feels great after cleansing! It really is a wonderful, gentle and non-irritating cleansing! It hasn't broken me out or caused any form of skin drying or irritation. It really is quite lovely! I'd definitely recommend. *I received this product free for testing from influenter*",Liverpool,No,0,0
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,A gentle exfoliant that gets the job done!,"I really have enjoyed using this product! I will start by saying that the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it just felt a little messy to me! The powder somes out pretty quickly and the paste can get a little saturated- apart from that it's easy to use! I have sensitive skin that is dry in some areas (particularly nose and chin) and this has dramatically reduced this. I don't usually like to use scrubs as often it leaves my skin feeling raw and red. This is very gentle, and left my skin feeling clean and fresh! There is no real strong smell to this product and it is super easy to wash off unlike other exfoliants. I would 100% recommend this to a friend and it is definitely getting repurchased!",London,No,0,0
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Gritty but makes my skin pretty :P,"I have combination skin with acne breakouts here and there. At first I used the Superfoliant two days in a row and my skin felt quite sensitive, so now I use it once a week or so and it really does make a big difference in skin texture and it helps prevent and help clear my breakouts. It's a great product especially for people like me who live in the city, you just need to cater it to your skin type :)",London,No,0,0
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Love it!,"my experience using it was nothing but excellent! I use it both morning and night to gently cleanse my skin. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth without feeling dry at the end. However, when it comes to its makeup removal capabilities, this is one I would recommend using it after a micellar water, cleansing oil or makeup removal wipes. This powder face wash is not powerful enough to dissolve and lift away makeup flawlessly, so it's best to use it in the evening as a second step cleanser, making sure your makeup is perfectly removed. On that note, there is no part in the claims where it was stated this product would effectively remove makeup, so this does not at all surprise me as I had no expectations for it to be able to remove makeup well.",Liverpool,No,0,0
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Certainly smoothing,This product does work well as an exfoliator but I wouldn't use it lots of times in one week as I feel like it's a bit stripping on my skin.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,An exfoliator that actually works :),"I got sent the Superfoliant to test out by Influenster. I realized that the product was a bit harsh to use everyday so I spaced the usage to about once every week or two weeks, and just after one use you can see a change in skin texture. It also helps prevent breakouts and leaves my skin feeling rejuvenated and new ( I use the skin smoothing cream and other products afterwards to avoid dryness and sensitivity)",London,No,0,0

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Such a great concept for a product.,"This 'Daily Superfoliant' is unlike any other product I've used before..It comes in a powder and you have to mix it with water (damp hands) and it creates a paste. When you apply this to the skin and massage it in it gently exfoliates the skin. This is very gentle on the skin but it really does the job.

Although this product is quite harsh it has completely cleared out my skin and my skin have never been so soft or even. It is quite harsh so would recommend being careful if your skin is more on the sensitive side! It is so easy to use and has become a staple in my weekly skincare routine.

The product doesn't really have a smell however if you use this and you have a cut or a raw blemish it does sting a little bit.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Unique little gem,When I first used this my main concern was it making my skin worse rather than better. I rarely deviate from my normal skincare routine in the worry that my skin might breakout but with the cold giving me dry patches and rough skin I desperately needed something improve it. Instantly after washing my face with this Dermalogica Superfoliant it felt smooth and free of dry skin. Immediately after my face was quite red but once the redness had subsided my complexion looked considerably clearer and brighter. It didn't aggravate or irritate my skin or cause any breakouts. I absolutely LOVE this it is a staple in my routine now and I cannot reccomend it enough!,Manchester,No,0,0
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Not worth the hype - not a daily cleanser,"Don't get me wrong, I really wanted to love this guy. I've used this for a couple of months now, and it honestly is just....meh, and borderline harsh on the skin. I have oily combination skin, and I don't really have major acne, but I do have some blackheads. Since I want to prevent wrinkles while I'm still in my early 20s, I figured, why not try it? Seemed like it would be perfect for me. Nope. Despite easing this into my skincare routine, using this made my skin go through a cycle of it being too dry, then producing more natural oils, which I would then need to remove with this cleanser because it was the only thing harsh enough to get rid off, etc etc. It made me have loads of small bumps a cross my jawline and cheeks (which I almost never had). I don't want to throw it out because it's a little bit expensive, so I'll only use this a couple of times a week, focusing on my nose and chin. 2 stars, and not a 1 because it could have been worse",Perth,No,1,0

I've been using this every other day for the past two weeks and my skin feels unbelievably smooth.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Amazing results,"I followed the instructions and tried this out everyday for about a week. I recieved this free from Influenster to try out and I loved it. It's super interesting and I have never used anything like this before. I like the fact it's a powder that then turns into a liquid consistency when put with water. This exfoliates very gently which I like and leaves your skin feeling the cleanest it has ever felt. However, I don't think my skin liked being exfoliated everyday even though it's a daily exfoliant. So i tend to use this product about every 3 days to not over dry my skin. It has a really nice smell to it aswell, not too powerful. Would definitely recommend to all skin types.",devon,No,0,0

Dermalogica superfoliant helped to restore the natural softness of my skin and fight the signs of pollution. My skin feels regenerated and light! The powder formula is indeed exceptional because a little quantity is enough for my daily routine!

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,MUST have for your new 2018 skin cleanse regime!,"I honestly cannot fault this product. As someone who has suffered from very vigorous acne over the years, I am very particular of what I use on my skin. Safe to say I will continue to use this as part of my facial cleansing routine as it just leaves my skin feeling smooth, refreshed and healthy. I usually cant use exfoliants on an every day basis, as they become too harsh on my skin and really aggrivate the skin. This superfoliant however exfoliates the skin beautifully, yet isnt too harsh and I can use it every morning without my skin burning or feeling as though my skins falling off! It doesnt smell of any chemicals, its simple to use - just pout a tablespoon size of the product on a wet hand and apply to a damp face in circular motions.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,One of the best exfoliators I have ever used,"This is such a cool concept for a skincare product! You pour a little of the powder into wet hands and start to mix it together, making a paste. Apply it to the face in circular motions to really feel it working to clean and exfoliate the skin.

When I wash this off, my skin feels really smooth and clean and it looks healthier and more glowy. Even after a couple of uses my skin texture seems to have improved and my blackheads appear reduced. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is that using this a few of days in a row really dried out my skin, so this is not a daily use product for me.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Skin miracle in a bottle,"I am a huge fan of the Daily Microfoliant and had used that several years ago.

My skin felt and looked smooth, it also felt so incredibly squeaky clean. I use a small amount of this in the shower and apply it to my face using small circular motions and then rinse it off. I have not as yet found a product that makes me feel like it gave my skin a deep clean. The active resurfacing ingredients do actually work in smoothing the skin while the charcoal, red algae and fruit extracts ensure all the daily pollution the skin has been exposed to has been cleared out.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Great Exfoliant!,"The Daily Superfoliant is great, as it garners results via enzyme exfoliation and chemical exfoliation. It's not a physical scrub with beads, rather a powder formula that you can make as strong or as light as you want which I appreciate. I'm not a huge fan of powder formulas but this is nice to have as an alternative to a conventional physical scrub, as this results in more of a foaming paste that I like to leave on for a few minutes. The results are definitely good and I'm left with clear and smooth skin. For those that don't like exfoliating beads, this could be a fantastic option and it is one I'd recommend as I know physical exfoliation can cause some controversy. Definitely worth investing in!",London,No,0,0

My nose was feeling rough and I tried this not expecting too much but was blown away by the instant difference to how my skin felt. The texture of my skin was so smooth and soft.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,A great exfoliant for clearing out pores,"I've really enjoyed using this! This charcoal-based powder exfoliant is meant to smooth skin while drawing out impurities from pores. I'm not usually a fan of physical exfoliants but I'm finding this to be really gentle so far and pleasant to use as long as I don't rub too vigorously! My skin feels smooth and looks brighter after using it, and it's done a good job at clearing out clogged pores. I'm excited to see the long term results on pigmentation as it also includes AHAs too. I personally wouldn't use it daily though, I think that's too frequent and potentially harsh - perhaps every 2 or 3 days (as I use other chemical exfoliants during the week). I've given it 4 stars due to the high price which might prevent me from purchasing (especially for a wash-off product) and the fact that I think daily use could be too much for most skin types. Gently used however, this is a great product. I received this product free for testing.",London,No,0,0
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Left skin feeling super soft,"I liked how soft and smooth this product left my skin. However I found using it every day was unrealistic as after three days in a row my face was stinging a lot, so I swapped to every other day or every other other day depending on how my skin was at the time. I used this along side the pre cleanse balm, the gel cleanser and the smoothing cream which left my face feeling clean and soft. However I suffer from oily skin and found that this rigourous regime left my skin oilier than ever, I assume due to the constant washing which left my skin feeling it needed to replenish itself. It did solve any dry patchiness I was Suffering from; however even with this in depth skincare routine, the pores on my nose And face were left blocked still causing me to have a fortnight of terrible breakouts and visible blackheads. I think this product teamed with a different face wash to actually clear the facial pores out would be an amazing duo.",London,No,0,0
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Great Skincare Product,"I really love this product, it makes my skin super smooth and really gives it a healthy glow! I like the idea of a powder exfoliant, it is something a little different to what I have tried before. The smell of the product is slightly strange, but nothing that bothered me whilst using it. Its very gentle on the skin, mine is slightly sensitive and I have had no issues using it. The only downside for me is the price - I do find it a bit on the expensive side. If it was a bit cheaper I would definitely repurchase it, but I'm not sure if I can justify £55 each time on an exfoliator!

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Love it!,This is the best exfoliant that I have tried! It cleans my skin super effectively and quick.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Totally into it,"I was not expecting much from this product since all the others daily superfoliants I've tried, I didn't like too much, however I loved the products from Dermatologica.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Pleased with the results,"After the first time using the product my skin felt instantly clean and smooth. I have slightly sensitive skin so alongside other products I was using, after the first couple of days using the products my skin became slightly dry. However, I switched to using it every other day and this immediately cleared up. It's very easy to use and you don't need much of the power to cover your whole face so the product lasts for a long time! The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts was because it has a slight smell that I didn't overly like. Apart from that, I love this product and would highly recommend! I received this product free for testing.",Reading,No,0,0
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Super soft skin,"To put this review into context, I want to add that my skin is oily but particularly dry in my T zone; I struggle with dry skin around my nose area on a daily basis and have struggled to find an exfoliant to combat it. The first time I used the product my skin became a little irritated, however I'm putting this down to the fact that I haven't used exfoliating products as part of my skincare routine for a while now. I tried it again a day later and I had no problems whatsoever. The exfoliant is super easy to use and I love how the charcoal makes it feel like a mix between a face mask and an exfoliant. The smell is quite musky but this is down to the charcoal; it wasn't unpleasant. My skin instantly felt smoother and looked brighter - something I haven't come across with any exfoliant I've used previously. I absolutely love the way it makes my skin feel! Combining it with the pre-cleanse balm, cleansing gel and post-exfoliant soothing cream has made my skin look and feel better than it has in years. The best part is that the dry skin on my nose hasn't been a problem since I began using the exfoliant. I recommend using a cleanser and toner prior to exfoliation and then a good moisturise after! Also a top tip - if you don't want to get the charcoal mixture on your hands too much, you can mix the powder in the cap with a couple of drops of water and then use your fingertips to apply it to your face - works a treat! Only downside would be the smell which wasn't an issue for me but may be unusual for other people. Overall though, this is a fantastic product and I'm so happy I've finally found an exfoliant that works on my weird oily/dry skin combo! Thank you! (I received the exfoliant free as part of an Influenster Voxbox.)",Manchester,No,0,0

I love how easy and quick this product is to use, you literally pour half a teaspoon of powder onto wet hands and then massage it onto your face and neck for one minute before rinsing it off. If you like exfoliators that aren't really harsh then this is the product for you, this products gentle exfoliates, enough to remove dead skin and impurities, without leaving your skin feeling stripped and looking red.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,The best gentle exfoliant ever,I have sensitive skin & I have a hard time finding products that will be too harsh and irritate my already irritated skin. This exfoliant is incredible and you only need a tiny amount and it goes a long way! I normally add a tiny amount to the palm of my hand and dribble water in to make a paste. I then lather this all over my face then add more water and rub it in again. You can leave it on for a few minutes but I normally take about 30 seconds just to ensure it is exfoliating my neck and face right. When I remove this with a face cloth my face IS red but it is definitely not irritated. No matter what time of day I use this my face is always dry skin and flake free!

It's definitely helped my acne scarring aswell, it's almost completely minimised after only using this product for 3 weeks.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Amazing,"I received a complimentary superfoliant to review, and this is my honest opinion. I have always loved dermalogica since I trained as a beauty therapist and we used dermalogica products at college. I have congestion prone skin that is managed with a dairy and meat free diet, but over the Christmas period I slacked a little and felt my skin needed a new year boost. This is very similar to the microfoliant with a fine powdery texture that lathers into a paste with water (and smells almost biscuity), but has a slight tingle to it which I assume is the water activated AHAs, I didn't find it uncomfortable though. I thought my skin looked amazing after first use, pores looked smaller and decongested, my skin was glowing and appeared more refined and smooth. I will continue to use every two to three days to acclimatise my skin but so far I am already very happy with the results. I followed up with skin smoothing cream. Dermalogica have upped their game and excelled themselves with the superfoliant, it really lives up to its name.",London,No,0,0
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Complimentary product but I will be buying again!,"I was sent this product to test out and I am usually dubious when it comes to exfoliants. Because my skin is so dry I'm scared to use exfoliators, I didn't want to cause my skin to produce more and all the exfoliators I've tried in the past have been useless. But this one is something else, I think because it's a powder you mix with water it's that much finer and not so abrasive. After using this product I found my skin was a lot smoother and unlike when I normally use water on my face, it doesn't feel as dehydrated. In my complimentary set I got sent a precleanser, a cleanser, the superfoliant and a moisturiser to try out, so I switched out my normal routine and used all of these together along with my clarins oil. I was rather happy with how this left my skin feeling so I'm going to bring this into my routine but every other night, I think my skin wouldn't be able to cope with every night. Once again I was sent this free to try out but all opinions are my own and non-biased.",Surrey,No,0,0
daily superfoliant,dermalogica,This WORKS,"I am usually skeptical about this sort of product and if it is really going to work and if it is really worth the price tag as its sometimes hard to part with large amounts of money for skin products that don't always make a difference. Honestly though, I am extremely happy with my Dermalogica Daily Superfoliant. The improvement in the texture of my skin was instant, my skin is insanely smooth after using this! My face feels superb, clean and fresh. I wear a lot of makeup and my skin can often be left dry and flakey, this is the answer to that and gets rid of the flakiness with ease. I worry about my skin a lot with my makeup use but feel much better now, I'm not a real sufferer of spots and only have one or two occasionally but I haven't had a single outbreak since using this. I have recommended to my sister who suffers with acne and she is currently trying it and the results are great so far.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,I'm so impressed with this product!,"I have been using the Daily Superfoliant for a few weeks now and I'm so impressed with it! I only use it a few times a week, as I use a few other exfoliant products in my daily skin care regime. But I have to say, this one has the most noticeable short term effects. After the first time of using it my skin felt noticeably smoother and softer, which is great for me as I really suffer with texture. My skin also felt cleaner too! I use this in my night time routine because, even though it's very easy to use, it is a little messy! For that reason, I think I'm going to start using it in the shower instead, that way you don't have to be so careful not to get the grey foam everywhere! I really enjoy using this exfoliant, and the fact that it's not at all abrasive on the skin is a definite plus for me.

After 7 days I saw vast improvement and after 3 weeks, almost total facial clarity. Now, 6 months later, I use it once a day and haven't had to see the doctor or an aesthetician in months.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,New skin!

I have read reviews previously about a burning sensation when using the product, however, I feel as though if it is mixed with the right amount of water the concentration should be so that it is perfectly comfortable to use on the skin - yet still with an active skincare result! I only gave the product four stars because as a more sensitive user I feel as though my skin definitely needed a good moisturiser afterwards because it was slightly dry.

daily superfoliant,dermalogica,Anti-aging all rounder. 5* review,"As a thirty something year old. Skin care has come to the forefront of my daily needs. This products sale pitch touts it as being anti-aging so when this arrives in my Influenster box I couldn't wait to get it on my face. As a bit of a skincare snob, dermalogica is a brand that I am familiar with however I am usually strictly a chemical exfoliants only kind of gal so this step of my skincare routine was always met with another brand. This product promises a a kind of 2 for 1 chemical exfoliant and anti-pollutant. The resurfaced works using AHA the chemical element - this works by gently using the chemical to loosen the bonds between your skin cells causing them to slough off leaving the fresh new layer beneath shining bright. To really pack a punch this multitasking wonder wash contains a triad of anti pollutants and antioxidants. These are affective at a cellular level. The activated Binchotan charcol absorbs toxins and pollutants that breach the epidermis, these pollutants are present in our everyday environment and the fight against them is real. They cause damage and changes to your skin at a deep level. Niacinamide improves cell nourishment, vital to ensuring healthy cells and this healthy skin. Red algae repairs the protective outlayer is with Tara fruit to promote efficient repair and regeneration. As said above I was fortunate enough to receive this item free from Influenster however all options are my own. I coupled this this treatment by double cleansing initially with the precleanse balm and massage pad (see desperate review) followed by cleansing foam used with my Clarisonic for maximum efficacy. This product comes third in my daily routine using half a teaspoon of superfoliant I apply to my wet hands and massage in for 1 minuet I remove with warm water and follow with a facial massage using the dermalogica phyto replenish oil - dermalogica. This is a vital step for relaxing those stressed out facial muscles that lead to those pesky wrinkles.",Chesterfield UK,No,0,0

You can keep massaging for about a minute and then use a damp cloth to remove it all!

I've found that living in London has really affected my skin and made it really congested and not many exfoliates will work without being too harsh on the skin, but this.. was amazing, you can tell it's really doing it's job. I like to let my face air dry after I wash it, just to make sure there's no extra bacteria from towels ect going onto my face after I've cleaned it! Sometimes this can make the face a little dry, so maybe a mixture between the superfoliant and me letting my skin try naturally has contributed to that. So straight after I pop on my Dermalogica skin smoothing cream, which soaks in almost instantly and made my skin feel amazing aswell!!! I can't recommend these products enough!

hydro masque exfoliant,dermalogica,Very Nice but Dispenser Broke,"I really do love this product, but Dermalogica could have put this in a tube and it would have been fine. Or a pump dispenser. I used this product one time, and during my second use, the white press dispenser collapsed and so I had to find a way to get the product out. Luckily, I have a metal tool for scrapping out the last bit of skincare. I had to shove the metal stick right through the collapsed dispenser and use it to push down the plastic bit you can see in the column and dispense product that way. So, although I love this product, as it makes my skin so smooth and soft, I HATE the dispenser. Granted, I now have a work around for using the product. However, for this price point I shouldn't have need one. So, I took 2 stars off just for the sheer frustration I have when using this mask.

hydro masque exfoliant,dermalogica,Hydrating but not greasy,"I've always enjoyed trying dermalogica products, mainly because they are normally out of my price range for something I would buy. I've been eyeing this hydromasque since it launched to help with some of the flakes I get on my face during the winter and transitional seasons. Using it was really easy, and it provided an instant burst of hydration once it was washed off. Now, I didn't find that hydration to be super long lasting, usually about a day or so and then my skin was back to being tight and dry, but that's typically with a wash off mask.

Overall, it's a fun little me time activity that both exfoliates and hydrates my skin. I will admit though, it has an interesting scent. It smells a little bit like celery (or perhaps some other green vegetable) to me but that doesn't stop me from using it.",VA,No,0,0
hydro masque exfoliant,dermalogica,Best I've Ever Used,"This is by far the best mask I have ever tried. It smells great, it feels amazing when putting it on, and it makes my skin feel so good. I have been using this mask once a week for about 3 weeks now, and I can honestly say, I love it. My skin is so clear and so smooth. I love the packaging of this product too, because it allows you to not overuse and run out of product too quickly. Even though this mask is a bit on the more expensive side, I will be purchasing it once I run out. Dermalogica has become a favorite skin care brand of mine, and I recently brought my husband over to this brand as well. We are hooked on this product and all their other products as well.",California,No,0,0

hydro masque exfoliant,dermalogica,"Innovative, unique, & effective","This mask is unlike any other I've tried thus far. It has unique packaging which is a double chamber style, and the product itself is inside a separate chamber. You press down the top of the packaging for the product to come out so you only get however much you need, ensuring less waste. It has little bamboo gel beads inside the formula that work to physically exfoliate the skin and burst upon contact, while the hydrating mask works to moisturize the skin while you're wearing. This mask deeply soothes and hydrates the skin, ensuring no irritation or stripping occurs despite the exfoliation process. Plus it's a super quick, easy process.

The consistency is creamy and the little beads dissolve as you rub them into the skin. This provides a very gentle exfoliation and you don't feel any harsh or abrasive particles on the face. I've tried other products in the past that scrub the skin's surface too much and then leave the skin irritated. However that's not the case with this product. It washes off easily with warm water, leaving my skin feeling clean, smooth and free of dead skin. Definitely worth trying.",California,No,0,0
hydro masque exfoliant,dermalogica,"Dermalogica is my go-to brand, this was a miss","As you can see in the headline, Dermalogica is my go-to brand when I'm buying skincare. I have been a longtime user of their cleansers, exfoliants, serums and more. To me, this Hydro Masque Exfoliant is a miss. First, the scent is pretty bad. It's not enough to make me say ""no"" to this. But, I've used other exfoliants (including some from Dermalogica), and to me, this did not feel exfoliating at all. A lot of this goes a long way, and no matter if I used too much product, enough, or barely any, I didn't really notice any exfoliating properties.","Moorestown, NJ",No,0,0
hydro masque exfoliant,dermalogica,"More of a hydrating mask, less of an exfoliant","I loved the lightweight cucumber smell of this mask. I also love the bottle with its rubber push button top that dispenses product through the bottom. Package-wise, I've never seen anything like it! To apply, use the product like you would any mask and massage in the exfoliating encapsulated bamboo and snow mushroom spheres into your skin then let it sit for 5 minutes. I enjoyed the product although the spheres did not exfoliate my stubborn dry skin. Regardless, my face did feel more hydrated after using the product. If you need a lightweight hydrating mask with gentle exfoliation purchase this but if you need more powerful exfoliation for visible dryness or flakiness on your face, I would look elsewhere.","Sunnyvale, CA",No,0,0

hydro masque exfoliant,dermalogica,"Lovely, hydrating exfoliant","I really like the Hydro Masque Exfoliant! I had a really hard weed and my skin was looking very rough. It was dull, rough from dry skin, breaking out, and just overall at its worst. This mask helped me lift the dead skin so you can see the clean, supple skin underneath, and it helped brighten and moisturize. I like that it's mostly unscented, although the natural smell reminds me a bit of the lactic acid lotion I use for KP (kind of like the smell of school glue) but it's very mild and the cucumber does help with that aspect of it. The mask helped hydrate my skin (although I still followed it up with hyaluronic acid serum because my skin is always dry and dehydrated) and I finally felt like my skin was super clean, after 5-7 days of being bedridden with an illness.

I will say however though that I am not a huge fan of the scent (although I did see the list of ingredients contains unusual things like mushrooms which aren't exactly known for smelling pleasant lol)-- it reminds me of clay or something like it.. kind of stale. I am torn over whether the bamboo spheres really do much of anything in terms of exfoliation as they don't seem for lack of a better word-- abrasive enough to get the job done? I'm not sure, but overall it doesn't bother me so I don't mind either way. One thing I really like about this product is its moisturizing component. My skin never felt stripped or overly tight and dry after using it, which is a common problem for me and some face wash/exfoliates. It also felt smooth and soft to the touch and I would say overall, brighter as well.

hydro masque exfoliant,dermalogica,Best exfoliant yet,This is my favorite and go-to exfoliant now. I had previously used the daily microfoliant and multivitamin thermal one.

hydro masque exfoliant,dermalogica,Great for my skin,"I have severe eczema on my face, the kind that cracks open. This did not irritate that, but I highly recommend sticking to the directions. I think the longer you leave it on, the more likely it is to get irritating. It does a good job of loosening dead skin but bc I have so much, I had to do a little work to get all the dead skin fully off. I would definitely recommend this, but I do believe it will take regular use for the exfoliation to be a ""wow"" factor. I'm just happy it was non-irritating!!!",Kansas,No,2,0

I did receive this product complementary for testing and review purposes so unsure of the price. The did receive a full size product and am happy with the amount of product that come in it and really like the pump on the back end that helps with pushing the product out. The texture of the product is fine, looks thick, but spreads thin and easily. The only thing I'm not too big on is the scent, it's somewhat hard to describe, maybe like aloe or clay.

multi-vitamin thermafoliant,dermalogica,My new Holy Grail scrub!,"Dermalogica's products have always been a hit or miss for me but I'm glad to say that this product is one of the exceptions! Is the few seconds 'warming' sensation when you apply this a bit gimmicky? I used to think so at first, but as I've continued to use it, I'm starting to think this is the one quality that sets this one apart from so many other great exfoliators I've tried, heat helping to open up pores and all that. And of course the ingredients working in these open pores have to be the part too and these definitely are...Retinol, AHA's, BHA's and some good botanicals. The exfoliating granules are finely milled, the Licorice and Vitamin C (combined with the acids) give a fantastic brightening effect, and most importantly my skin feels perfectly smooth afterwards. I love how you're always in control with the amount of exfoliation, on dry skin it works most intensely, but add water if you wish to make it less intense, and the more water you add, the less it will be. Just over 1 minute of gently working this into my skin and I'm done, and I only use a small amount, you don't need lots as you do with so many other scrubs. I like the fragrance of this product and despite the oily consistency of it, I find it adds a bit of hydration into my skin which sometimes (being oily/combination) is just about all the hydration I need. There is a slight residue, but once I've towel dried my face it all but disappears. Pricey yes, but as I mentioned a little goes a long way, so be expecting this to last longer than you expected! -> My 'Ulta Beauty Top 7 must-have list' (My 7 favorite beauty products of all time, focusing mainly on my purchases at Ulta) < - < 1.

I realized once I got home and checked on-line, this was not the case; but since I had this one coming to me via mail, decided to try it. Dermalogica is a good line; and although this mask did warm my face, considering the hefty price, it's certainly no better than the Biore 6 individually contained masks in foil packets which I've used in the past.

multi-vitamin thermafoliant,dermalogica,"A genuine, visible difference - AMAZING product","I am so thankful that my Dermalogica therapist recommended I switch from Daily Microfoliant to the Thermafoliant. I've always believed in exfoliating but wasn't always regular with it as I never really saw that much difference. I started using Thermafoliant a couple of months ago and was immediately taken with how unbelievable my skin felt afterwards - it felt like satin, almost slippery smooth. It also feels really nice with the warming effect. My skin overall is pretty good - I'm 41 but have minimal lines and am usually mistaken for early thirties, for which I credit using Dermalogica for over 10 years now and avoiding the sun. However I had an incredibly aggravating skin tag type thing next to my left eye that really bothered me. It was almost like a wart but skin coloured - maybe 4mm in diameter. It would occasionally flake but if I tried to remove it it was painful and would bleed - gross. My dermatologist told me he could surgically remove it but it might leave a scar so I put it off. However it was bothering me so much I was literally about to make the appointment for surgery when I suddently realised it had COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED. No scar, no mark, nothing. It was like it was never there. The Thermafoliant had completely sloughed it off after just a few uses. So this product saved me an expensive dermatologist procedure that would probably have involved stitching and/or slight scarring. I've also had people comment on how good my skin looks at the moment, and that's in the middle of a brutally cold and dry east coast winter. My pores are visibly smaller, and my skin overall is clearer and looks younger. I cannot recommend this product highly enough. Please never change it!","New York, NY, USA",Yes,11,0

I can't wait to see what my skin will look like in just 30 days since it's only been a week!

multi-vitamin thermafoliant,dermalogica,Nice addition to the routine,About a year ago I went into my local Dermalogica story (Scottsdale) and wanted to try a bit of a stronger exfoliant than the Daily Microfoliant (which I love) for my t-zone area to help clear out blackheads a bit more. I first tried the Skin Prep Scrub but that was a bit too harsh for my sensitive skin so then tried this one and it's great. I like to use it once or twice a week and then the Daily Microfoliant on the other days. I find it helps just clear out a bit of the extra congestion in my t-zone area and makes my skin feel super smooth.

multi-vitamin thermafoliant,dermalogica,From a Picky Skeptic to One Who Tells You to Go Get One,"Alright guys! I'm picky and was tired of getting skin care that was hyped up and overpriced. Brand names were charging for their name and drug store products were hit and misses. So back to the review. I went into ULTA with very dry and flaky skin. When I say dry and flaky, the dessert is what you should picture. I had foundation on and you could really see how bad it was. I have combination skin. An oily T-Zone, dry around and on my nose, my chin, and also some on my temples. The rest is normal. I had an amazing girl listen to me and only for that reason I gave Dermalogica a try. I purchased the gel cleanser, this Thermafoliant, and the oil-free face lotion. I though if I didn't like it, I will bring it back. I was diligent to do my part. I started immediately. You guys, by day four, I was blown away! After day four, I put my foundation on, and I saw maybe two little spots of dryness and definitely no flaking. This thermafoliant feels so amazing when you use it. When you put it on your skin with water, it warms up, and it feels like a little spa day for your face. The grit is a perfect size and it does not scratch your face but it does the perfect job of exfoliating your face. With as much dead skin as I had on my face, I cannot believe that I saw such a quick turnaround and I am in my late thirties. I did not use any other products other than the three I've mentioned. It has been around three weeks now and my skin has never looked any better. I know the price is up there but this product will last you for quite a long time. If you're like me and like shopping online, I hope this review helps. If you get a chance to stop by an ULTA store, ask them to give you a tiny drop of this so you can feel how it warms up and exfoliates on the top of your hand.",Spartanburg SC,No,4,1
multi-vitamin thermafoliant,dermalogica,One of My Favorites!,"I use this product two to three times a week. It's a great exfoliator as the beads are gentle on my skin, and I especially love the scent of the geranium oil. The heat-activating feature is a nice touch as well.",Los Angeles,No,0,1
multi-vitamin thermafoliant,dermalogica,This is amazing stuff,"I use this every day in the shower, after using the Dermalogica calming cleanser for sensitive skin. Just a small amount, about 1/4"" squeezed out gets rubbed between my fingers and onto my forehead, nose, and chin. My face feels very smooth afterwards, the grit is very fine so it feels like it's doing something without being harsh. I've tried the powdered exfoliant by the same brand, it's okay but I went back to this because it is the bomb.",Neenah WI,Yes,2,2

multi-vitamin thermafoliant,dermalogica,Great product,"I've been using this product for nearly a year - I get regular peels/treatments and use it 5 days after a session to remove any dead skin. I then use it once every 2 weeks at night to remove any dirts or pollution in my skin and it leaves it feeling soft, smooth and glowing! It is an intense/rough scrub, hence why I do use it weeks apart to avoid damaging my skin. I get so many compliments on my skin and it's mainly due to this scrub leaving me fresh-faced and glowing! I'd recommend consulting your beautician to see if this product's suitable for your skin.","Melbourne, AUS",No,5,2

multi-vitamin thermafoliant,dermalogica,Great on many levels!,"I was chatting with an Ulta skincare consultant about the difficulty I have with my dry and eczema addled skin. I had to recently spend a few days in the freezing, dry, windy snowing Central NY area and when I returned to Florida, I could not get the flare-up on my face to calm down. Among the other items he suggested was this as an exfoliant. He tested it on the back of my hand and the results were amazing! I've been using it for a couple of weeks (every 3 days) and can already see an overall difference in my complexion. Not only did it help smooth out all the flaking, it has made a huge difference in the brightness of my skin. I have continued to use it on the backs of my hands and am pleased with the improvement they show. I only have to use about a pea-sized amount for face and the same for hands. No more ""old lady"" leather! I'm not normally a fan of the ""Premium"" lines, but this miracle-in-a-tube is worth every penny!","Naples, FL",Yes,4,0
